Look at you.<br><br>You're so healthy.<br><br>Look at your biceps.<br><br>What about your dad?<br><br>We haven't had contact with him<br>since he left us.<br><br>So you mean your mom never remarried?<br><br>Never.<br><br>That's why her entire<br>life is focused on me.<br><br>I told you.<br><br>Hey, where were we?<br><br>Big Bang.<br><br>Good evening ma'am.<br><br>You're still awake.<br><br>Do you need anything?<br><br>I was just going to get some water.<br><br>I'm sorry I didn't bring some upstairs.<br><br>It's fine.<br><br>- Here let me.<br>- No it's okay.<br><br>I'll do it.<br><br>Maybe I should've<br>gotten a mini refrigerator.<br><br>That way you don't need to<br>come down for water.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>How are your studies?<br><br>You know Pol is...<br><br>I love you.<br><br>What did you say?<br><br>I love you ma'am.<br><br>I've been holding this back<br>for so long but...<br><br>I can't anymore.<br><br>I'm practically your mother.<br><br>Like what people always say...<br><br>""age doesn't matter.""<br><br>It does matter.<br><br>You still address me as an elder.<br><br>Sometimes we're not sure about our feelings<br><br>especially the younger ones.<br><br>I am sure.<br><br>For a long time now.<br><br>And I'm not a child anymore. I'm 19.<br><br>I know what I want.<br><br>I think it's better<br>if you don't come here for a while.<br><br>Hi Migs!<br><br>We'll start early tonight okay?<br><br>Have dinner here as usual?<br><br>- Let's separate before you ruin all our things.<br>- I don't care about our things.<br><br>I don't think<br>I'll be able to make it tonight.<br><br>- I'll be busy tonight.<br>- Let's split up.<br><br>Huh?<br><br>I need your help with my paper.<br><br>Would you rather we work at your place?<br><br>Is there a problem?<br><br>No it's okay.<br><br>- That's the only thing you're good at! Cursing!<br>- How about this… let's just work there again.<br><br>But you should text your mother first.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Just tell her that<br>I'm going to sleep there tonight.<br><br>Okay. No problem.<br><br>I didn't know you were coming tonight.<br><br>I could have prepared.<br><br>Sorry ma'am.<br><br>I did tell Pol that I<br>couldn't make it tonight.<br><br>Mom, we have exams tomorrow.<br><br>Migoy is my secret weapon.<br><br>All that natural science stuff<br>is so easy for him.<br><br>I don't even know why we have Natural Science<br>when our course is Mass Comm.<br><br>Good thing he's good in all our subjects.<br><br>Thank you for helping Pol.<br><br>Pol can do it, he just needs<br>a bit more confidence.<br><br>Here.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>That one's dirty.<br><br>- Hurry up. Get dressed.<br>- Later.<br><br>Come on and get dressed.<br><br>Pol might see you.<br><br>Why? We aren't doing anything wrong.<br><br>This is the last time we're meeting okay?<br><br>Are you regretting what we did?<br><br>Huh. You're not talking politely anymore.<br><br>In this world people of all ages,<br>gender and nationalities make love.<br><br>But it's no big deal<br>because they love each other.<br><br>That's what I want to know.<br><br>Do you love me too?<br><br>Maybe.<br><br>That's alright.<br><br>All I know is I'm sure.<br><br>Maybe we should take our time okay?<br><br>Why? Don't you want to see me anymore?<br><br>I do.<br><br>You know, Claire.<br>We don't need a formal relationship.<br><br>We can just go along and see<br>what will happen eventually.<br><br>All I know is I want a<br>relationship with you.<br><br>You sound so sure of your feelings.<br><br>I have never been more sure<br>in my entire life Claire.<br><br>Let's just take our time okay?<br><br>This is my first time.<br><br>This is my first time too, Claire.<br><br>All I ask is you don't tell Pol about us.<br><br>And that we can only meet here.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Alright.<br><br>Hello Alma?<br><br>I'll be a little late,<br><br>please tell Mr. Gonzales to wait for me.<br><br>Prepare everything<br>we're going to present to him.<br><br>Yes ma'am.<br><br>I fixed everything last night.<br><br>Okay, see you.<br><br>Bye.<br><br>(Migoy: Good Morning)<br><br>(Claire: Morning. But don't text me,<br>Pol might see it.)<br><br>(Migoy: I understand. Love you!)<br><br>(Claire: Bye!)<br><br>(Migoy: I said, ""Love you"".)<br><br>(Claire: Love you!)<br><br>My earliest memory with my Mom<br>is whenever I have a problem at school<br><br>or when I'm not feeling good,<br>she always brings me here.<br><br>She always tell me to look around<br>and I will see endless possibilities.<br><br>That we can achieve anything.<br><br>That's why I should never limit myself.<br><br>But she did ever since my Dad left us.<br><br>Then when she found out about my heart defect,<br><br>the transposition of the great arteries.<br><br>She gave up on her dream to be a writer<br><br>and looked for a regular job.<br><br>But I've been saving for a long time.<br><br>Mom's not aware but<br><br>I save all the money she gives me.<br><br>Someday I'll give it back to my Mom.<br><br>So she can stop working<br>even if only for a year and just write.<br><br>You really love your Mom.<br><br>These days I don't feel like being around her though.<br><br>I feel suffocated by her attention.<br>She micromanages my life.<br><br>You just need to try to understand her.<br><br>You're so lucky to have her!<br><br>That spot's beautiful.<br><br>There?<br><br>Over there.<br><br>Where?<br><br>I see it.<br><br>Let's go there.<br><br>- Hi Mom.<br>- Hi ma'am.<br><br>We'll have early dinner. Barbeque.<br><br>Perfect.<br><br>I just told Migoy we need to be thrifty.<br><br>Yeah. That is my favorite.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>We'll have dinner soon.<br><br>Come on?<br><br>Come on!<br><br>I love you.<br><br>I love you too.<br><br>I love you.<br><br>I love you.<br><br>Pol?<br><br>Are you awake?<br><br>We should talk.<br><br>I have to tell you something.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>I'm in love with your Mom.<br><br>She likes me too.<br><br>Are you angry?<br><br>You think it's wrong?<br><br>Since when?<br><br>A couple of days ago.<br><br>If you guys are happy,<br>there's nothing wrong.<br><br>You mean you're okay with it?<br><br>Oh my God.<br><br>I'm so happy.<br><br>You really are my best friend.<br><br>What do you mean best friend?<br><br>I may be calling you daddy soon.<br><br>Crazy.<br><br>Just…<br><br>don't hurt my Mom okay?<br><br>Why would I do that?<br><br>I love her.<br><br>You can't imagine how happy I am.<br><br>Dude…<br><br>I'll make her the happiest woman<br>in the world.<br><br>Mom?<br><br>Pol.<br><br>What a waste.<br><br>This attic hasn't been used in a long time.<br><br>Well you don't come up here anymore.<br><br>You told me not to<br><br>because I bothered you while you wrote.<br><br>I loved watching you write<br><br>so I kept coming back.<br><br>I was fine listening in from the stairs.<br><br>But Dad got mad because I wouldn't listen.<br><br>That night... was the only time<br>I ever saw him so mad.<br><br>Your Dad left us that same night.<br><br>I chased him to the garage.<br><br>I told him.<br><br>I wouldn't go back to the attic<br>so long as he stayed.<br><br>He left us for another woman.<br><br>I know<br><br>but I never went back<br>to this attic since then.<br><br>I thought if I stayed away,<br>he would come back to us.<br><br>Mommy...<br><br>why did you stop writing?<br><br>Because I needed to work.<br><br>Mommy you should write again.<br><br>Didn't you have some novels<br>you haven't finished yet?<br><br>I've gotten rusty.<br><br>I don't have time for that.<br><br>I need to work.<br><br>I already know Mom.<br><br>Know what?<br><br>About you and Migs.<br><br>I told him not to tell you.<br><br>Mom.<br><br>Mom, I told him that it's alright with me.<br><br>If you're against it, I'll end it.<br><br>Mommy, I've always wanted you<br>to fall in love again.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>You don't know how happy you've made me.<br><br>I think this is the right time for me<br>to confess something too.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Mom I'm gay.<br><br>Of course.<br><br>I know.<br><br>I'm just waiting for you to tell me.<br><br>Is it obvious, Mom?<br><br>No.<br><br>But I'm your Mom.<br><br>Migoy doesn't know okay?<br><br>There's no problem.<br><br>Do you want me to tell him?<br><br>No, mom.<br><br>Why not?<br><br>It's OK to come out<br><br>while you're young.<br><br>Just go.<br><br>Be happy with who you are.<br><br>Do you want Migoy and I to go with you<br><br>to those places that gays like going to?<br><br>We could go to gay bars or the sauna place.<br><br>Or we could sign up<br>for those pride parades.<br><br>That would be fun.<br><br>Come on!<br><br>Find a boyfriend so we can double date.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>It's okay if you're not ready.<br><br>You can experiment and then...<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>There's nothing wrong<br>with doing flings, alright?<br><br>The most important part is that<br><br>you just practice safe sex.<br><br>Okay?<br><br>Mommy.<br><br>Mom, why would I have sex with just anyone?<br><br>I want my first sex to be with<br>the one I love.<br><br>That will only happen once.<br><br>I agree.<br><br>So fall in love quickly.<br><br>Mom.<br><br>I want you to marry again.<br><br>Migoy and I are still in the<br>""getting to know each other"" stage.<br><br>But if we're going to<br>talk about marriage...<br><br>Don't worry.<br><br>You'll be the first one to know.<br><br>I'll bring you to the altar.<br><br>Who else?<br><br>The wedding should be held<br>at your favorite spot.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Only family and close friends<br>should be invited.<br><br>And we'll fill the place<br>with your favorite flowers.<br><br>Then we'll play your favorite sappy songs.<br><br>So you think they're sappy.<br><br>They're not sappy.<br><br>I love you Mommy.<br><br>I love you too.<br><br>A pig's orgasm lasts for 30 minutes.<br><br>You're so gross!<br><br>While lions can mate<br>for up to 50 times a day.<br><br>But that's purely<br>for procreation.<br><br>While humans and dolphins are the only<br>species that have sex for pleasure.<br><br>How do you know so much about sex?<br><br>I just read about it.<br><br>Read huh?<br><br>Where are you going?<br><br>I'm just going to get something<br>from the car, Mom.<br><br>Stop it.<br><br>What do you want to eat tonight?<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>This is for you.<br><br>Add that to the tip I left.<br><br>Thank you so much ma'am.<br><br>You're so generous.<br><br>I guess that's why you're lucky.<br><br>You're gorgeous<br><br>and your sons are handsome too.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Come on Pol.<br><br>Let's get married.<br><br>What?<br><br>From bed to church?<br><br>That fast?<br><br>Why not?<br><br>Because you're still young.<br><br>Please.<br><br>Stop telling me that.<br><br>No. What I mean is<br><br>that we should take our time.<br><br>That's all.<br><br>Cause why not?<br><br>Do you really love me<br><br>or are you just letting out<br>your pent-up sexual energy?<br><br>Wow. You think that's all you are to me?<br><br>No. Seriously.<br><br>Answer me.<br><br>How much do you love me?<br><br>Are you fishing for compliments?<br><br>Come here.<br><br>I love you<br><br>from your toes to the top of your head.<br><br>Okay…<br><br>From the Big Bang<br><br>to a pig's orgasm.<br><br>Okay, more.<br><br>From now<br><br>until forever.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Do you know<br>why I'm certain that I love you?<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because I don't know why.<br><br>Now it's your turn.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>I want to introduce you to my parents.<br><br>No.<br><br>No.<br><br>You and Pol can have dinner at our house.<br><br>No.<br><br>No, no.<br><br>That's awkward.<br><br>Please, please.<br><br>No.<br><br>No.<br><br>You already refused my marriage proposal.<br><br>If you regret this, don't blame me okay?<br><br>Never.<br><br>Did you say you're in a relationship?<br><br>Yes, Dad.<br><br>Just recently.<br><br>You mean you're going to be<br>my daughter-in-law?<br><br>We aren't going to get married yet,<br><br>he just wanted me to meet you.<br><br>You've met Pol, haven't you?<br><br>What will you live on?<br><br>Dad she's the one with a job.<br>I'm still a student.<br><br>Pardon my husband.<br>That's just how Noel is.<br><br>He talks without thinking.<br><br>All I have to say is<br>don't rush into things.<br><br>Getting married isn't like something<br><br>that you can take back so easily.<br><br>It's not like that.<br><br>Yes, I agree.<br><br>The menudo is great by the way.<br>Did you cook this?<br><br>Yes I did.<br><br>Enjoy the dish.<br><br>I'll give you the recipe later.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>I'm really sorry.<br><br>I couldn't stop myself.<br>I won't do it again.<br><br>Please, can you look at me?<br><br>You have nothing to be ashamed of.<br><br>I was just surprised<br>because I didn't know you were gay.<br><br>Mom is the only one who knows.<br><br>I'm not gay.<br><br>I know.<br><br>And I'm in love with your mom.<br><br>Please don't tell her.<br><br>Can we pretend that nothing happened?<br><br>Maybe it's best if you sleep in Mom's room.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>No.<br><br>I should be the one apologizing.<br><br>You're still my best friend.<br><br>I just want you to know<br>that you didn't offend me.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>You're still my best friend.<br><br>Come here.<br><br>This will go away.<br><br>Don't worry, this will go away eventually.<br><br>I know. I know.<br><br>Here what about my cousin?<br><br>Not my type. He looks too gay.<br><br>Why? What's wrong with that?<br><br>Enlighten me.<br>Do gays just like straight men?<br><br>Wouldn't it be more logical<br>if they liked gay men too?<br><br>Here. This is my other cousin.<br><br>He looks like he's going to beat me up.<br><br>Hey. He's really nice.<br><br>He just looks a little intense.<br><br>What's your type anyway?<br><br>Maybe you're looking for someone like me.<br><br>Don't be so full of yourself.<br><br>If only I had a sibling<br>who looks just like me.<br><br>How would that work out?<br><br>You're going to be my father.<br><br>And my boyfriend would be<br>my brother's sibling?<br><br>Then my boyfriend would be my uncle.<br><br>Stop playing matchmaker.<br><br>I know. Let's try Tinder.<br><br>Just let it go.<br><br>I just want you to be happy.<br><br>I am happy.<br><br>Happy like your mom and I?<br><br>Pol.<br><br>Don't feel sorry for me.<br><br>I'm sorry Pol.<br><br>You're home early.<br><br>Mom I don't feel so good.<br><br>I want to rest.<br><br>Do you want me to make some soup?<br><br>No thanks.<br><br>I'll just rest upstairs.<br><br>Did you and Migoy have a fight?<br><br>Why do you think that?<br><br>He hasn't texted me for a while.<br><br>He's probably just busy.<br><br>Pol!<br><br>Pol!<br><br>Pol!<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>His heart ailment recurred<br>and this time it can't be cured by surgery.<br><br>How are you?<br><br>I thought I was ready.<br><br>When Pol was young,<br>the doctor said he might not live long<br><br>and that his heart condition<br>might come back.<br><br>I kept hoping the doctor is wrong<br>because he had the operation.<br><br>I don't know what to do.<br><br>I don't know what I'll do if I lose him.<br><br>I don't know what I'll do…<br><br>What did the doctor say, Mom?<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>He said you should just rest<br>and to avoid stress.<br><br>Mom.<br><br>I already know.<br><br>I've accepted it.<br><br>I'll just get more stressed<br>if you don't tell me the truth.<br><br>Mom.<br><br>I've been prepared for a long time.<br><br>I'm actually lucky to<br>have lasted this long.<br><br>Don't talk like that.<br><br>The doctor is doing<br>everything he can, okay?<br><br>He's talking to a specialist in Singapore.<br><br>We will do everything we can, Mom.<br><br>But beyond that, we have to accept<br>what we have to.<br><br>Who wants to die?<br><br>But I should be grateful.<br><br>I knew long ago<br>that my life could be cut short.<br><br>I'm glad I was given a chance<br>to live this long.<br><br>Come on man.<br><br>Don't talk like that.<br><br>Let's look at it this way.<br><br>You with all that information in your head<br><br>what is the probability<br>of a person dying at any age?<br><br>Any time?<br><br>Even without a disease.<br><br>I could drown.<br><br>I could get run over.<br><br>I could even die in my sleep.<br><br>In the end,<br>we don't have control over death.<br><br>I might live longer than either of you.<br><br>Nothing's going to happen to you.<br><br>You'll get better soon, okay?<br><br>- Okay?<br>- Okay.<br><br>Come on. Let's go.<br><br>Pol, did you see my keys?<br><br>(Migs I thought I told you<br>to stop looking for a partner for me?)<br><br>(Why are you sending me photos? )<br><br>(Stop it. I've accepted it.)<br><br>(It's just too bad, I ended up liking you.)<br><br>(I'm not expecting anything, okay?)<br><br>(Just make my mom happy.)<br><br>Claire.<br><br>I'll just leave the two of you.<br><br>Yes Ma.<br><br>Can we talk.<br><br>Can't do it at home.<br>Pol might overhear us.<br><br>Sure.<br><br>Is there a problem?<br><br>I read the text message Pol sent you.<br><br>All this time I didn't know<br>he felt that way for you.<br><br>Why didn't you tell me?<br><br>He made me promise not to tell you.<br><br>Can you fall in love with my son?<br><br>What?<br><br>I pity my son, Migoy.<br><br>If there's anything Pol hates the most,<br>it's pitying him.<br><br>And you think you know my son.<br><br>He has accepted<br>that I don't have feelings for him.<br><br>That you're the one I love.<br><br>He's happy for both of us.<br><br>And all this time he has been hurting.<br><br>He is sick, Migoy.<br><br>Are we going to change<br>what we feel for each other,<br><br>just because he's sick?<br><br>I love Pol too.<br><br>He's my best friend.<br><br>All I wish in this world<br>is for him to get better.<br><br>But we don't need to sacrifice<br>our feelings for each other for his sake.<br><br>We need to break up.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Isn't it obvious?<br><br>I can't bear hurting my son.<br><br>If we're going to break up,<br>it'll hurt all three of us.<br><br>But we have more strength to handle it.<br><br>He doesn't.<br><br>He's still young.<br><br>He can't handle the pain.<br><br>What about me?<br><br>Don't you feel bad for me?<br><br>I'm young too, Claire!<br><br>Now you're young too?<br><br>I thought you were old enough for this?<br><br>Have you ever tried<br>listening to Pol, Claire?<br><br>What do you mean?<br><br>You take care of him<br>but you never listen to him.<br><br>And what right do you have<br>to talk to me this way.<br><br>He's more mature than you think.<br><br>Sometimes more mature than us.<br><br>Let's end this.<br><br>Don't set foot in my house.<br><br>Who's the childish one now?<br><br>I've made my decision.<br><br>Do you need anything else?<br><br>Sleep early alright?<br><br>Mom, I'm not an invalid.<br><br>Sorry my son.<br><br>Mom?<br><br>Has Migoy messaged you?<br><br>He's not answering my calls.<br><br>Mom?<br><br>I thought you said no secrets?<br><br>I won't be seeing him.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Did he do anything wrong?<br><br>None.<br><br>Don't you love him anymore?<br><br>I do.<br><br>Mommy.<br><br>I read the text message you sent him.<br><br>I broke up with him.<br><br>Do you know what hurts me, Mom?<br><br>You hurt me.<br><br>You always treat me like I'm still a child.<br><br>You never listen to me when I tell you<br><br>that I can take care of myself.<br><br>You have to give me that respect, Mom.<br><br>Give me that at least.<br><br>That I'm no longer a child.<br><br>That I'm responsible.<br><br>Whatever I'm going through,<br><br>whatever problems I have,<br><br>I can handle it.<br><br>Can't you give me that?<br><br>What's keeping you awake?<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>Your Papa and I have been fighting a lot.<br><br>I understand, Ma.<br><br>At first, I was annoyed by it.<br><br>But lately I realized<br>that all that fighting<br><br>is just a part of your relationship.<br><br>That's part of how you love each other.<br><br>That's why I shouldn't judge you.<br><br>You have your own world<br><br>where you've decided<br>what kind of relationship you want.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>You're right, you know.<br><br>I can't live without your fool of a father.<br><br>I'm sure he feels the same way.<br><br>Ma.<br><br>It's Pol.<br><br>Why?<br><br>What about Pol?<br><br>He's sick.<br><br>Claire has stopped seeing me.<br><br>Pol?<br><br>Pol?<br><br>Pol?<br><br>Pol?<br><br>Pol?<br><br>Pol?<br><br>Pol?<br><br>Pol?<br><br>I'm sorry for what happened last night.<br><br>I know I overdid taking care of you.<br><br>No, Mom.<br><br>I should apologize<br><br>because I overreacted.<br><br>It's right for you to take care of me<br><br>and I should take care of you.<br><br>Mommy?<br><br>Can you please bring Migoy back?<br><br>I feel bad for him.<br><br>Yes, my son.<br><br>Mom?<br><br>Mom.<br><br>Mom?<br><br>It's not true that I sacrificed<br>everything for you.<br><br>When I was pregnant with you<br><br>and your Dad left us,<br><br>I tried to abort you.<br><br>The abortion failed.<br><br>You survived.<br><br>You were a miracle.<br><br>You are a miracle.<br><br>Since then.<br><br>I blamed myself.<br><br>That maybe the reason<br>why your heart is weak<br><br>is because of me.<br><br>Because I tried to kill you.<br><br>So when your Dad came back,<br><br>I was consumed by my guilt.<br><br>I was never a good wife.<br><br>I was very selfish.<br><br>It's hard to admit one's faults.<br><br>And I have a lot of faults.<br><br>Mommy.<br><br>Mommy, you're not at fault.<br><br>Mommy.<br><br>Pol...<br><br>Pol?<br><br>Pol?<br><br>Pol?<br><br>Pol!<br><br>Pol?<br><br>Pol?<br><br>Pol!<br><br>Pol!<br><br>Pol!<br><br>Pol!<br><br>Pol!<br><br>Pol!<br><br>Pol!<br><br>Pol!<br><br>The fainting spell<br><br>is an indication that<br><br>his condition is getting worse.<br><br>Even the specialist in Singapore said<br><br>that they can't do anything about it.<br><br>How is

The Inbetweeners (2011) - full transcript,"Best friends Will McKenzie, Simon Cooper, Jay Cartwright and Neil Sutherland - who are not among the social outcasts, but also not cool enough to hang out with the cool kids who they aspire to be - have just graduated from their suburban London high school. Simon has finally been able to get Carli D'Amato, who he has been in love with since they were children, to be his girlfriend. Largely because they will be going away to different schools in the fall, Carli breaks up with him. To get Simon's singularly focused mind off Carli, his three best mates decide to take him on vacation for two weeks to get some sun, sand and girls before they move onto the next chapter of their lives in the fall. Neil makes the decision for them to go to Malia on the isle of Crete, a popular summer tourist destination for many a Brit. Jay, with inheritance money in hand, believes he can have the pick of any girl he wants. Neil has to decide what constitutes not cheating on his girlfriend, Nicole. Will wants to add a bit of culture into the vacation. And Simon still pines for Carli, getting her off his mind being more difficult when he learns why Neil chose Malia. What starts off as a disastrous vacation has the potential to pick up when they meet fellow Brits Alison, Lucy, Jane and Lisa, who pair up with Will, Simon, Jay and Neil respectively, and with who they hang, out of circumstance, for much of their time in Malia. Will the virgin, who generally makes Alison laugh, has no chance with her as she is far out of his league, and as she is already in a serious relationship with a Greek waiter named Nicos. Jay is ashamed to be seen with self-assured Jane, because she is overweight. Neil treats Lisa like any other female with who he wants to have non-cheating ""sex"". And Simon may not see that Lucy really does like him despite his singular focus on Carli. All these issues are placed against the backdrop of the guys trying to get tickets for the all-day boat cruise, seen as the party of the season, and at which all their dreams - at least in their dreams - will come true.","<div class=""full-script"">api.OpenSubtitles.org is deprecated, please<br>implement REST API from OpenSubtitles.com<br><br>So, you see the thing is, Dad,<br>I could reapply next year,<br><br>but if I defer and try again for Oxford,<br>I'll probably lose my place at Bristol...<br><br>Mm...<br><br>which is a good university<br>but not my dream.<br><br>Do you think<br>it matters in the long term,<br><br>or is the subject and standard of degree<br>more important?<br><br>So, I got married.<br><br>- What?!<br>- To Suzy, we got married.<br><br>You mean remarried.<br><br>This time it's for keeps, though.<br><br><script async src=""https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-9736463211397065"" crossorigin=""anonymous""></script>

<br><br>- Mm-hm.<br>- Fine.<br><br>I dunno.<br>I guess I'll be going on holiday.<br><br>Oh, this should be good.<br>What have you got planned?<br><br>Trans-Siberian Express?<br>Fossil-hunting in Dorset?<br><br>Or maybe something even weirder.<br><br>No, actually. Something normal. I'm going<br>somewhere normal, with my normal friends,<br><br>to a place full of normal people.<br><br>And you, of course.<br><br># Wahhhhh<br><br># Gimme love, gimme love, gimme love<br><br># I really need it<br><br># Gimme love, gimme love, gimme love<br><br># Just set me free, yeah... #<br><br>In case you were wondering,<br>that was me with my father.<br><br>And this is where I live -<br>not with him, but with my mother.<br><br>It's a long story. Well, not that long.<br><br>He shagged the work experience girl<br>and then left us.<br><br>So, just clichéd, really.<br><br>Plus, it only happened two years ago,<br>so I don't even get the luxury<br><br>of blaming my various personality defects<br>on their divorce.<br><br>Anyway, that's how I ended up here -<br>the very definition of suburbia.<br><br>Safe, comforting, stifling, boring -<br>and I couldn't wait to fucking leave.<br><br>Maybe that's unfair, as they do say<br>that you never know what goes on<br><br>behind the net curtains of suburbia.<br><br>Although, in my friend Jay Cartwright's<br>case, you can have a pretty good guess.<br><br>Are you ready to have some fun, big boy?<br><br>Mmm.<br><br>I'm feeling sexy!<br><br>Take off mask, baby, let me see you.<br><br>Nah.<br><br>Do you promise this'll be<br>properly filthy, yeah?<br><br>Oh, yes, like bomb explode from in penis.<br><br>Sexy like... mmm...<br>finger up bumhole.<br><br>Christ, you make me so erect.<br><br>Oh, yes, you also make me erect.<br><br>Now, put in card details.<br>Oh, I'm so horny.<br><br>Don't forget security number and bank.<br><br>Mm! Come on, hurry up.<br><br>All right, Jay's mum! Where's Jay?<br><br>Oh, hello, Neil.<br>He's at home, updating his CV.<br><br>Ooh, excuse me.<br><br>Hello?<br><br>Ohh...<br><br>It's a bit over, is that OK?<br><br>Not really.<br><br>- Excuse me! My prawns?<br>- Sorry, mate, I finish at six.<br><br>Cheers for that.<br><br>- You don't have to thank me every time.<br>- Oh, right. Cool.<br><br>You're so fit.<br><br>Simon, we need to talk.<br><br>Oh, not talking!<br><br>- Look, it's been great so far...<br>- It's been amazing.<br><br>Literally the best year of my life.<br><br>My spots clearing up,<br>not moving to Wales,<br><br>and now you.<br><br>And I'm definitely getting better<br>at kissing, aren't I?<br><br>I think we should break up.<br><br>What?<br><br>We're both going away to uni soon,<br><br>and it'll be too hard to keep it going<br>long-distance.<br><br>- It won't be fair on either of us.<br>- I don't mind.<br><br>You will mind, though. You will.<br><br>I bloody won't!<br><br>Plus, I'm going on holiday soon,<br>so there's that.<br><br>Why? What are you planning to do<br>on holiday?<br><br>Maybe you should just go home.<br><br>I just need some space to think<br>at the moment.<br><br>OK, fine. So, I'll see you later, yeah?<br><br>Or whenever?<br><br>Mum, I'm back! When's tea?<br><br>- In a minute.<br>- It had better be delicious!<br><br>Ohhh...<br><br>- Ooh!<br>- Oh, oh!<br><br>Tell me you love me. Tell me you love me.<br><br>Oh, yes, I like you. Oh, I like you.<br><br>Get out! I'm just looking at holidays!<br>It's just holidays!<br><br>Jay, can you come downstairs, please?<br>Your grandfather's died.<br><br>Ooh, you've got a lady there,<br>you bad boy!<br><br>Has she got nice titties? Suck on<br>the lady's titties. Suck them, go on!<br><br>It was our last ever day of school,<br><br>something my new stepmum had<br>experienced only four years ago herself.<br><br>So the head of Sixth was going to say<br>a few inspirational words.<br><br>And if ever there was a man for the job,<br>it wasn't lunatic giant Mr Gilbert.<br><br>I will forget each and every one of you<br>almost immediately.<br><br>So, if you do find yourself<br>at a loose end next year,<br><br>and think it might be nice to pop in<br>and see how we're getting on,<br><br>don't. This isn't the Dead Poets Society<br><br>and I'm not that bloke on BBC Two<br>who keeps getting kids to sing in choirs.<br><br>I especially don't want to hear about<br>how well you're settling down at uni<br><br>or how much growing up you've done<br>in the past 12 months.<br><br>At best, I am ambivalent<br>towards most of you,<br><br>but some of you, I actively dislike,<br><br>for no other reason<br>than your poor personal hygiene<br><br>or your irritating personalities.<br><br>I hope I've made myself clear<br>on this point.<br><br>And in case any of you think<br>I'm joking... I'm not.<br><br>I assure you<br>that once my legal obligation...<br><br>to look after your best interests<br>is removed,<br><br>I can be one truly nasty fucker.<br><br>Good luck with the rest of your lives<br>and... try not to kill anyone.<br><br>It reflects very badly on all of us here.<br><br>Slightly more upbeat<br>than I was expecting.<br><br>They say your school days<br>are the best days of your life.<br><br>But the only way<br>that would be true for me...<br><br>would be if I went straight from school<br>to prison and stayed there until I died.<br><br>How many times is that<br>she's caught you now?<br><br>Four. But this was the worst.<br><br>Mask, snorkel, ham.<br><br>OK, one last one for luck.<br><br>Ooooh!<br><br>Good. Old-school wedgie.<br>To be admired, in a way.<br><br>Squashing the balls now.<br>Ooh! That does not tickle!<br><br>Argh!<br><br>Mark! What the fuck<br>do you think you're doing? Put him down.<br><br>All right, calm down.<br><br>Just saying goodbye to Bender Squad.<br><br>- Have a nice life, dickheads.<br>- Oh, grow up! God!<br><br>- Are you OK, Will?<br>- Fine! Slightly chafed arse crack,<br><br>- but, no, basically fine, thanks.<br>- Hi, Simon.<br><br>OK, well, bye, then.<br><br>Fucking bitch.<br><br>Is she?<br><br>No.<br><br>Oh, God... I just really miss her.<br><br>It's all right, mate. I understand.<br>Anyone would miss those tits.<br><br>- It's not that, Neil.<br>- Is it her lovely snatch?<br><br>- No.<br>- I know it feels rough now, Si,<br><br>but you just need to give it some time.<br><br>I'm just worried I'll never get over her.<br><br>- I can help you with that!<br>- Can you?<br><br>Yeah! From now on, every time<br>you mention the Moanatronic 5000,<br><br>- you get a slap in the balls.<br>- Do you mean Carli?<br><br>Ow! For fuck's sake, Jay!<br><br>- You were warned.<br>- How's that helping?!<br><br>Stopped you from crying like a baby,<br>for one.<br><br>So my life is still ruined,<br>but now my balls ache too. Thanks, Jay<br><br>No, your life is just about to begin,<br>mate!<br><br>Now you've been dumped, we can all go<br>on a mental holiday together.<br><br>Two weeks of sun, sea, sex, sand, booze,<br><br>sex, minge, fanny and tits.<br><br>And booze.<br><br>And sex!<br><br>He's put it horrifically,<br>but he's probably right.<br><br>A holiday would definitely<br>take your mind off her.<br><br>Plus, it's the perfect time to go.<br><br>Yeah, they say the summer is<br>the perfect time for a summer holiday.<br><br>Come on, Si, what do you say?<br>The lads on tour!<br><br>- And you.<br>- Yes, and me! One of the lads.<br><br>Yeah, fuck it, go on, then.<br>Maybe it will help.<br><br>Course it will!<br>And, I promise you, Si,<br><br>we'll go somewhere<br>so full of fit birds,<br><br>it'll be like shooting<br>clunge in a barrel.<br><br>What a lovely image<br><br>So, that was it.<br>We were no longer schoolboys.<br><br>And to prove our independence,<br><br>we were off on the holiday of a lifetime<br>without our parents...<br><br>after we'd made them pay for it.<br><br>I know this is the first time you've ever<br>been away from me, but don't go crazy.<br><br>When have I ever gone crazy?!<br><br>That time you drank all that shandy<br>at Debra's wedding. You went pretty wild!<br><br>- I was seven years old!<br>- He was running round, his pants down,<br><br>shouting, ""I've got a white slug!""<br><br>- Mum!<br>- Oh, hello, Kevin!<br><br>Looks like just Jay<br>we're waiting for, then.<br><br>Yes, it does ""look like"" that,<br>doesn't it? God! Sorry about her.<br><br>Are you all right, Neil?<br>Your face is a bit weird.<br><br>Fine! Just popped a bit of my sister's<br>fake tan on, get it started, you know.<br><br>Just on your face?<br><br>Well... It's on my hands now too.<br><br>All right? Who's this, then, the vicar?<br><br>Me? No, no, I'm Kevin. I'm Neil's father.<br>Nice to meet you.<br><br>Where's Neil been hiding you, then?<br>The church?<br><br>- Looks like a bloody vicar, don't he?<br>- No, no, I'm not a vicar.<br><br>No, I know that. But you look like<br>a vicar and you talk like a vicar.<br><br>A bloody gay vicar, or something!<br><br>Well, I'm not a vicar and I'm not gay.<br><br>No, I'm saying you look gay.<br><br>But you can't be, can you? Cos old<br>soppy bollocks here come out your pipe.<br><br>Right, I see.<br><br>Well, gotta get going.<br>Don't want you to miss that flight.<br><br>Bye-bye, Pookie Petal. Love you, mwah!<br><br>Oh, and Jay? If you're gonna spend<br>your grandad's money chasing skirt,<br><br>two things. One, make sure she's not<br>a hound like the last one.<br><br>And two, try to be a man when she dumps<br>you for someone with a bigger cock...<br><br>...which is everyone!<br><br>Dad!<br><br>Dads are like arseholes.<br>Everyone's got one, yes,<br><br>but also, they're arseholes. Which is why<br>they make excellent cab drivers.<br><br>Takes me back, all this -<br>cheap flights at ungodly hours.<br><br>Where is it you're headed to again?<br>Simon never tells me anything.<br><br>- Malia, Mr Cooper, in Greece.<br>- Can't say I've heard of it.<br><br>Of course you haven't,<br>it's a cool place to go.<br><br>And it's got a Subway's.<br><br>Oh, right. In my day,<br>it was all about Spain.<br><br>Me and my mates went to Magaluf<br>this one time.<br><br>Shagaluf, we called it!<br><br>Should've called it Shagalot. And hard.<br>Anything that moved.<br><br>We had a system.<br><br>Always left a hat on the bedroom door<br>when one of us got lucky.<br><br>Was usually me.<br><br>Oh, Dad, please shut up!<br><br>I don't know what it is,<br><br>but you'll find girls just seem to<br>let themselves go a bit more abroad.<br><br>It's like as soon as they smell<br>the sun cream, they get wet.<br><br>- Your mother's the same, even now.<br>- Oh, God, just drop us here!<br><br>I was learning a lot<br>about holidays.<br><br>And not just what they did<br>to Mrs Cooper's front bottom.<br><br>I was also learning<br>that on a lads' holiday,<br><br>it's compulsory to wear<br>""hilarious"" matching T-shirts.<br><br>Here y'are.<br><br>Nice!<br><br>Right, you owe me 12 quid each.<br>Except for you, Will, you owe me 20.<br><br>Right, so I've got to pay more money<br>for a T-shirt I didn't ask for<br><br>and I'm not going to wear, cos it carries<br>a nickname I didn't know I had?<br><br>- Yes.<br>- Great<br><br># Come on, come on, come on, come on<br><br># Got my peeps standing with me<br>at the bar doing shots<br><br># Cos now we're so fucking plastered<br>we don't know when to stop<br><br># I got my peeps standing with me<br>and I'm having a blast<br><br># I'm feeling so fucking good right now<br>I want it to last<br><br># I'm at the bar and I see this chick<br>checking me out<br><br># From afar, yes, she wants my dick<br>There ain't a doubt<br><br># Now I'm in a lift, getting lips<br>How dumb is this girl?<br><br># But do I care?

Carli!<br><br>Carls!<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>Oi, Jay, Jay...<br><br>Tidy minge, ten o'clock.<br><br>Jay? Jay!<br><br>Didn't you see them girls?<br><br>Why don't you chirps 'em?<br><br>- I can't handle that many at once, Neil.<br>- Really? What about that netball team?<br><br>Yeah, that was all right,<br>cos that was a luxury caravan.<br><br>But this coach is way too small<br>for my moves.<br><br>Ah, course.<br><br>Right, so, the plan is<br>get to the apartment, unpack,<br><br>get some sleep,<br>then head out fresh tomorrow.<br><br>First up, the Minoan Palace at Knossos.<br><br>Have you come on a lads' holiday<br>by mistake?!<br><br>We haven't come<br>halfway round the world...<br><br>to look at some boring fucking<br>Greek ruins.<br><br>Yeah, you can see that shit<br>anywhere.<br><br>We go there, drop the bags off,<br>then go straight out and get spasticated.<br><br>Simples.<br><br>But I've not slept for 37 hours.<br><br>Shut up and try and get<br>some sleep on here, then.<br><br>Fine, good idea.<br><br># We love you Burnley, we do<br><br># We love you Burnley, we do<br><br># We love you Burnley, we do<br>Oh, Burnley, we love you!<br><br>- # Oh, Burn-a-ley<br>- # Oh, Burn-a-ley<br><br>- # Is wonderful<br>- # Oh, Burn-a-ley is wonderful... #<br><br># Can you hear the Preston sing?<br>I can't hear a fucking thing... #<br><br>When people ask me if I like<br>football, I say yes.

You have fun.<br><br>But not too much fun.<br><br>You shit on floor - 50 euro fine.<br><br>Each time!<br><br>All right, lads!<br><br>- Are you stopping here?<br>- Yes. We are.<br><br>Bad luck.

Is that the bath?<br><br>Course it's not the bath,<br>you fucking idiot. There's the bath!<br><br>That's the... kids' toilet.<br><br>- Is it?<br>- Yes!<br><br>Why's it got a plughole and a tap, then?<br><br>Cos it's for checking your kid's shit<br>before you flush it.<br><br>- Urgh, that's grim!<br>- Yeah, I know.<br><br>That's the Continentals, innit?<br>They're dirty.<br><br>See? That looks nice!<br><br>I'm not sleeping in a fucking bathtub<br>for two weeks, Simon!<br><br>We'll have to share the sofa bed.<br><br>Ooh, 'ello!<br><br>Right, well, while you two decide<br>who gets first go on each other's cocks,<br><br>I'm getting ready and getting out there.<br><br>The gash isn't gonna fuck itself,<br>you know.<br><br>Charming<br><br>Finally, smelling like an<br>industrial accident at the Lynx factory,<br><br>and looking like the world's<br>shittest boy band, we hit the town.<br><br>- Ooh, heads down, boys.<br>- Shit.<br><br>What? Why? We haven't done anything!<br><br>- Foreign police, innit?<br>- So?<br><br>Don't you even know about foreign police?<br><br>What, short-sleeved uniforms?<br>Chunkier truncheons?<br><br>- Oh, fucking hell!<br>- Mate, they're all corrupt.<br><br>Basically, if you misbehave<br>and don't have the money to bribe 'em,<br><br>they take you up<br>to these shepherds' huts in the hills,<br><br>beat you up and bum ya.<br><br>And if they don't kill ya,<br>you kill yourself,<br><br>cos of the shame of getting a boner<br>whilst you was being bummed.<br><br>Right, couple of things. Firstly,<br>the hills here are full of timeshares,<br><br>not deserted shepherds' huts.<br><br>Secondly, Crete's in the EU,<br>so I think the standard of policing<br><br>probably goes beyond bumming<br>and forced suicide.<br><br>Believe what you want. I'm keeping<br>a bribe up my arse just in case.<br><br>You're gonna spend the whole holiday with<br>20 euros rolled up inside your arsehole?<br><br>It's been up there since<br>the seatbelt signs went off, mate.<br><br>All right, lads! Holiday, is it?

Well, if you really are<br>the Pussay Patrol...<br><br>- Which we are.<br>- You're obviously going to Marco's.<br><br>It's the most<br>buzzing bar out here.<br><br>Always packed<br>with a chilled-out, sexy vibe.<br><br>- Know what I mean?<br>- I don't really know what you mean.<br><br>When you say ""sexy vibe"",<br>do you mean girls?<br><br>Course! Loads of girls.<br><br>I'll sort you out half-price drinks<br>and a free fishbowl.<br><br>Cool, cool, cool.<br><br>So, will you be in there,<br>with your sexiness,<br><br>making the vibe all... sexy?<br>Being all sexy, and that, sexy?<br><br>Say ""sexy"" more.<br><br>Well, I will be if you're gonna be there,<br>you saucy bugger!<br><br>Come on, then!<br><br>Here you go, these four. I'll see you<br>in a bit. Mine's a Bacardi and Coke.<br><br>Large one?<br><br>Saucy! See you later.<br><br>Fucking hell, you're well in there, mate!<br><br>Yep! He shoots, he scores.<br>Right up the vag.<br><br>Oh, my God, if she's outside,<br>imagine the birds inside!<br><br>Ah. Interesting.<br><br>Well, it must get going a bit later.<br>She did say it was amazing.<br><br>And why would she lie?!<br><br>All right, mate. Four pints, four<br>Jägermeisters and a fishbowl, please.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>- When it good here?<br>- Sorry?<br><br>Er, when here party good?<br><br>In normally about an hour or two.<br><br>Oh. Well, as we've paid,<br>maybe we should hang on, then?<br><br>But this year... never.<br><br>- Thanking you, very much.<br>- OK, let's go.<br><br>Fuck off! My bird'll be down in a minute.<br><br>Do you mean the woman who's clearly<br>on commission to trick people<br><br>into this empty bar?<br><br>No, I mean the little hottie outside<br>that I was flirting with.<br><br>I'll take that as a yes, then.<br><br>I'm going nowhere<br>till she's sucked me off!<br><br>- So you're going nowhere.<br>- Jay, we're on holiday!<br><br>I'm meant to be out there, trying to<br>hit on girls I think are beneath me<br><br>but who, for their part, won't give me<br>the time of day! So, let's go!<br><br>Ooh! Hello, hello! It's those little<br>lovelies from the coach!<br><br>- That one's not so little.<br>- I think they're looking at us.<br><br>And not in a weird, terrified,<br>""leave us alone"" way. Amazing!<br><br>Jay, you're drunkest.<br>Go over and talk to them.<br><br>Nah. Not me, mate. None of them<br>are as fit as my one outside.<br><br>Why go for hamburgers<br>when you've got steak at home?<br><br>If, like you, you have neither anywhere.<br>It's up to you, then, Si.<br><br>Oh, shit, really?<br>I don't know if I'm over Carli.<br><br>- Ow! Fuck! Can you stop that?!<br>- Yes, I can.<br><br>When you stop being<br>such a pussy about your ex.<br><br>It's time to get back<br>on the horse now, Si.<br><br>And those little ponies need feeding.<br><br>Feed the pony.<br><br>Yeah, OK, I'll introduce us,<br>but we've all got to go over together.<br><br>- Great.<br>- You fucking sad cases.<br><br>You don't just walk up<br>to a girl in a club...<br><br>and introduce yourself!<br>That's creepy.<br><br>Clubs have different rules,<br>you dick.<br><br>Look, you dance over near them, make<br>the eyes, then get 'em to dance with you.<br><br>Really?!<br><br>- Annoyingly, that does sound right.<br>- Thank you!<br><br>And then, after a bit,<br>you stand up behind them,<br><br>pretend to slap 'em<br>and fuck 'em up the arse.<br><br>- That might be a bit much.<br>- Yeah, I dunno...<br><br>- Oh, fucking hell, I'll do it.<br>- - What about Nicole?<br><br>It's only dancing,<br>she likes my dancing.<br><br>Stick with me,<br>you'll be fine.<br><br>Right, then, Si.<br>Looks like the holiday starts here.<br><br>We No Speak Americano)<br><br>Am I doing it right? Am I in time?<br><br>Maybe a bit out, but not so you'd notice.<br>Copy Neil.<br><br>Sorry. Do you mind<br>if we come and talk to you?<br><br>Cos you look nice, and, frankly, this is<br>just humiliating for everyone involved.<br><br>Um...<br><br>Sit down, Specs.<br><br>Hello. I'm Lucy.<br><br>Hi, I'm Diamond... Simon!<br>I'm Simon.<br><br>I'd better not get stuck<br>with the fat one.<br><br>So, when Alison<br>initially suggested Malia,<br><br>we all thought,<br>yeah, why not?<br><br>It'll be ironic.<br>Then we had a reality check<br><br>and we thought, do we honestly wanna<br>spend 2 weeks somewhere being ironic,<br><br>and obviously the answer was no,<br>so then we looked at other places,<br><br>but we realised, actually,<br><br>we just wanna have a laugh<br>and go clubbing and get drunk...<br><br>and be silly, and that this might<br>genuinely be a good place to come,<br><br>so fuck it, here we are.<br><br>Just so you know, I've met a really<br>fit bird, and she'll be along any minute.<br><br>OK. She won't mind you talking to me,<br>then, will she?<br><br>If our dancing was bad...<br>and it was bad...<br><br>then our small talk was even worse.<br><br>They were useless. It was up to me, and<br>so I dived in with my best chat-up line.<br><br>- I'm Will, by the way.<br>- Alison.<br><br>So, do this place hire you out as<br>some sort of avant-garde dance troupe<br><br>to scare the customers off?<br><br>No. I lost my mind and agreed to come<br>here on holiday. What's your excuse?<br><br>Sort of similar.<br><br>I came out here earlier this summer and<br>fell crazy in love with a gorgeous local,<br><br>- so now I'm back.<br>- Hilarious. Course you did.<br><br>What was he, a barman or a waiter?<br><br>- Waiter.<br>- Brilliant. Was he called Stavros?<br><br>- Nicos.<br>- Too good.<br><br>I bet he's different to all the boys<br>back home!<br><br>Yeah. He understands women, for one.<br><br>I'm sure he does.<br>Must get enough practice.<br><br>Not only had Jay not offered<br>to buy Jane a drink,<br><br>he'd now stopped paying for his own.<br>Meanwhile,<br><br>Simon had finally found a subject<br>he was sure Lucy would love.<br><br>It was devastating cos she's definitely<br>the most beautiful girl I've ever met.<br><br>She's so fascinating,<br>she's really funny, you know.<br><br>Oh, right. In what sort of way?<br><br>Just like, you know when something's<br>funny and people get it?<br><br>Yes?<br><br>So in that way. And also in a comedy way.<br><br>Neil was a man of few words.<br><br>But even for him, this was ridiculous.<br><br>Luckily, he had a trump card to play.<br><br>D'you wanna dance?<br><br>Meanwhile,<br>Alison didn't seem to be enjoying...<br><br>my hilarious Greek waiter impression.<br><br>So, I presume he wooed you with the old,<br>""Hh'I love you, hh'I love you!<br><br>""You hh'only girl for me!<br>There's no hh'other girl hh'in my life!<br><br>""Oh, wait, here comes the next plane<br>from Newcastle. I've gotta go, baby"".<br><br>Sorry, you do realise<br>I'm not playing along with the joke.<br><br>I do genuinely have a Greek waiter<br>boyfriend called Nicos.<br><br>No, of course you do.<br><br>Brilliant. Nicos.<br>You've really nailed the clichés.<br><br>- You are joking, aren't you?<br>- No.<br><br>His grandmother has as moustache<br>as well if that makes the stereotype...<br><br>even funnier.<br><br>I'm sorry. I'm sure he's not like<br>every other waiter out here.<br><br>It's fine. You don't know<br>what you're talking about.<br><br>Your accent was pretty good, though.<br><br>Oh, I've gotta go. Don't want to miss<br>my stereotypical Greek boyfriend.<br><br>He might get angry and smash some plates.<br><br>Or commit atrocities in Anatolia.<br><br>You're not normal, are you?<br><br>So then Carli said we needed some space.<br>And uni's coming up,<br><br>- so maybe she's right.<br>- Sorry, who's right?<br><br>- Carli?<br>- Who?<br><br>Carli, my ex?<br><br>You went out with a girl called Carli?<br>You should've said<br><br>What? I did!<br>That's all I've been talking about.<br><br>Oh!<br><br>Yes, I was joking!<br><br>Sorry for going on about her. I usually<br>get a smack in the balls to stop me.<br><br>What?!<br><br>Um, nothing.<br><br>You all right, Lise?<br>Where's that bloke you were dancing with?<br><br># I've got nothing but love for you<br><br># I've got nothing but love for you<br><br># I've got nothing but love for you... #<br><br>Luce, we should go. Nicos finishes soon,<br>and I don't want to miss him.<br><br>So, shall we all hang out again sometime?<br><br>Yeah. You lot don't seem too bad.<br><br>If I hear another bloke out here<br>refer to women as ""gash"", I'll scream.<br><br>- Yeah, yeah, yeah. No that is horrible<br>- It's awful...<br><br>- when men do that. Disgusting.<br>- Really bad.<br><br>Do you fancy coming to the all-day<br>boat party, Friday?<br><br>I know it's meant to be sold out, but<br>our rep reckons he can still get tickets.<br><br>All-day boat party - what's that?<br><br>Well, it's a party.<br><br>OK.<br><br>- All day.<br>- Yep.<br><br>- On a boat.<br>- Oh, right.<br><br>Well! Now that's been cleared up,<br>we should go.<br><br>See you later, Will.<br><br>Amazing.<br><br>Do you realise, we just danced over,<br>chatted up some girls,<br><br>they loved it and you didn't fuck it up!<br><br>- Me?!<br>- Are we players?<br><br>I'm starting to think that here, unlike<br>at home, we might actually be players.<br><br>Maybe. I'm not really sure<br>what that means.<br><br>However, cos I've not slept now<br>for two days, I'm going to bed.<br><br>Yeah. My eyeballs feel like<br>they've got paper cuts.<br><br>- Jay, are you coming?<br>- Fuck that!<br><br>There's a fit bird up there<br>who's so wet for me,<br><br>I can hear the waves breaking<br>in her fanny.<br><br>I'm gonna down this, then take her down<br>the beach and fuck her brains out.<br><br>Right, well, we've established<br>that isn't happening.<br><br>Fine. Watch me.<br><br>Mm. Classy<br><br>We'd better get Neil.<br><br>- Neil...?<br>- Oh, God! We're off.<br><br>Right. Won't be a minute,<br>I'll just finish up here.<br><br>Christ, Neil, what about Nicole?<br><br>Oh, she won't mind, we're not kissing.<br><br>Nah. It's just fingers, in't it, lover?<br><br>Right.<br><br>Yeah. I'll catch you lot up. One second.<br><br>He's definitely picked up the pace.<br><br>While Neil picked up<br>his finger-banging speed,<br><br>we picked up Jay - and he had<br>a chilling prediction to share with us.<br><br>She's gonna suck my knob-knob dry.<br>You watch.<br><br>I'd rather not watch,<br>if it's all the same to you.<br><br>Shit, is that Carli?<br><br>Look, Si, it's normal<br>that after a break-up,<br><br>you'll think you see her everywhere,<br>but she's not here.<br><br>Yeah. I suppose.<br><br>- Could be her.<br>- What?<br><br>Could be her.<br>She is out here at the moment.<br><br>What?!<br><br>Well, we weren't sure where<br>the best place to go was,<br><br>and her and her mates are pretty cool,<br>so I asked them where they was going<br><br>and when, and that's why I booked Malia.<br><br>You fucking idiot!<br>I came away to try and get over her!<br><br>- Did ya?<br>- You know I did!<br><br>Oh, yeah, course.<br><br>Oh, God, look at her.<br><br>Do you think this is fate?<br>Her being here, me being here.<br><br>No. I think Neil asked her<br>where she was going<br><br>and then booked the same place,<br>like he just said.<br><br>Let's go before she sees us!<br><br>No, no. I've got to go and talk to her.<br><br>If there's even the slightest chance<br>of us getting back together,<br><br>I've got to take it.<br><br>Carli!<br><br>Carli?<br><br>Simon?!<br><br>Oh, my God! What are you doing here?<br><br>Stalking you abroad.<br><br>No. The opposite, actually.<br>Just a mix-up by my friends.<br><br>My stupid fucking idiot friends.<br><br>Well, whatever. It's great to see you.<br><br>Is it?!<br><br>Yeah, it is. Course.<br><br>Course.<br><br>So, as we're here, why don't we hang out?<br>How about right now?<br><br>Now? Oh, I can't now. But you'll be<br>at the boat party on Friday, right?<br><br>The boat party? I was literally<br>just talking about the boat party.<br><br>It's gonna be amazing. The best way<br>to round off our holiday.<br><br>What? Why are you going? Don't go.<br><br>I've got to go.<br>My flight leaves on Saturday.<br><br>The boat's our last chance to party.<br><br>Right. Well, I'll definitely be there,<br>then.<br><br>For total, one million per cent.<br>Definitely.<br><br>Cool. It'll be great to hang out again.<br><br>- I've missed you.<br>- Hmm?<br><br>Argh, Jesus!<br><br>- Fuck it!<br>- Sorry, mate.<br><br>- James! Are you all right, Simon?<br>- Yeah, fine. Argh!<br><br>I'll walk it off.<br><br>Cool, yeah. Carls, come on,<br>we've gotta go.<br><br>Oh, do you two know each other?<br><br>Yeah, James is our rep.<br><br>Rep, unofficial rep. I sort out club<br>nights. A bit of party organising, PR...<br><br>Just make sure everyone's having<br>a good time, you know what I mean?<br><br>- Are you sure you're all right, mate?<br>- All good...<br><br>Cool. Carls, come on.<br><br>Bye, Simon. See you on the boat.<br><br>See you, mate. Mind that leg.<br><br>I'll sort you out a free fishbowl.<br><br>Oi, baby, you stood me up!<br><br>Ah, didn't wait long enough, sweetheart.<br><br>Come on, kiss me.<br><br>I'm working, darling.<br><br>I love your boobs.<br><br>What?!<br><br>What gives you the right to touch me,<br>you fucking prick?<br><br>Wha...?<br><br>Sorry, I think he might've had<br>a little too much of the old drink.<br><br>I am sick of every dickhead<br>thinking he's got touching rights,<br><br>just cos I smiled at him.<br>It's my fucking job, you cretin!<br><br>Are you on the blob?<br><br>Sexy. I like it.<br><br>- No, Jay. Time for bed.<br>- Fuck that!<br><br>You two can bum yourselves to death<br>on the sofa bed.<br><br>I'm going to get another drink.<br><br>Jay, don't be insane.<br>You're too drunk already.<br><br>I'm on fucking holiday.<br>You can't be too drunk!<br><br>- You coming, Neil?<br>- Nah, I like it in there.<br><br>And not sleeping for two nights is pretty<br>much the same as not sleeping for one.<br><br>Right, fine.<br><br>Fucking knobheads.<br><br>How was your chat?<br><br>Amazing. Carli is here, Will. That's what<br>she was worried about, us being apart.<br><br>That's why we split up.<br><br>But we're not apart,<br>because we're both here.<br><br>I just need to get on that boat.<br><br>Actually, can one of youse help me?<br>I think she might be a two-man job.<br><br>What happened to your leg?<br><br>- Oh, I got a little bit run over.<br>- ""A little bit run over""?!<br><br>The next morning,<br>I was woken up...<br><br>by what sounded like<br>Bigfoot having an asthma attack.<br><br>Simon...<br><br>Simon!<br><br>Christ, it's like a sauna in here.<br><br>Have you got any water?<br><br>What the fuck is that noise?<br><br>I think it's Neil.<br><br>Oh, no, not the dinner lady<br>from last night!<br><br>I cannot understand a thing you say.<br><br>Spunk all over me bastard tits.<br><br>Well, it's her or Johnny Vegas.<br><br>Fucking smack it!<br>Smack it, you little prick!<br><br>Is that all you've got?<br><br>- Shall I bite it?<br>- Interesting question.<br><br>This is beyond creepy.<br><br>Twist it right fookin' off!<br><br>OK, I'm getting out of here!<br><br>Harder!<br><br>How can I have spent 100 euros?<br><br>Holy shit,<br>I only budgeted 15 euros a day!<br><br>Great,<br>so I spunked all my money...<br><br>- in one night.<br>- All right!<br><br>Oh, Jesus, Neil!<br><br>Oh, don't worry about that.<br>It's on the way down.<br><br>- Don't you feel bad about Nicole?<br>- Who?<br><br>Nicole, the girlfriend<br>you've just cheated on?<br><br>Oh, no, no, cos we weren't kissing<br>and only the tip went in.<br><br>Any more than the tip is cheating, and I<br>would never do that, cos I've got ethics.<br><br>- Right...<br>- Anyone want breakfast?<br><br>No, I'm going to go<br>to the Palace Hotel.<br><br>It's where those girls we met<br>are staying.<br><br>Well, at least you've found<br>someone to stalk,<br><br>other than Carli.<br>Ow! Not me, Neil!<br><br>Lucy reckons their rep can still get boat<br>party tickets, actually.<br><br>Yeah, I'll come. Alison was nice. Neil?<br><br>Can't, I had a nightmare.<br>I left my trunks in England, didn't I?<br><br>Wear your Calvins.<br>They're practically the same.<br><br>- Can I, Will?<br>- Um, yeah, I suppose.<br><br>- And can I bring a ball?<br>- Yes, Neil. Yes, you can.<br><br>Cool. Oh, have you guys seen Jay?<br><br>Shit, no, not since last night.<br><br>No, I mean have you seen him?<br>He's over there.<br><br>So Jay had slept<br>face down in the dirt.<br><br>But I'd woken up listening to Neil<br>getting sucked off.<br><br>As far as I was concerned, he won.<br><br>Urgh, ohhh!<br><br>Face...!<br><br>Yeah, you've got something on your face.<br><br>It appears Jay's slept in an ants' nest.<br><br>Argh! Pain!<br><br>Tongue...<br><br>It's all right, boys. Kitty don't bite.<br>Not now she's been fed.<br><br>Hey, lover?<br><br>What the fuck was that?!<br><br>Unsurprisingly, the girls' hotel<br>was nicer than our hotel.<br><br>There are North Korean prison camps<br>which are nicer than our hotel.<br><br>But, like a North Korean prison camp,<br><br>it was overcrowded,<br>so we had nowhere to sit.<br><br>- What about there?<br>- They've got towels on them, Neil.<br><br>- So?<br>- That means people have bagsied them.<br><br>- We can't take those.<br>- Fuck that!<br><br>- No, Jay, we can't!<br>- Watch me!<br><br>It's probably just a load of Krauts<br><br>that got down early in the morning<br>to reserve 'em.<br><br>That towel's got Finding Nemo on it.<br><br>What, so Nazis can't like Disney too?<br><br>- Jay!<br>- Besides, I really need a lie down.<br><br>My head's more fucked<br>than Neil's dad's arsehole.<br><br>Jay, please!<br><br>Jay and Neil were off to,<br><br>as they put it,<br>""check out the chicas"".<br><br>But I had a serious problem.<br><br>In the absence of my mother,<br>or a teacher,<br><br>I needed help with my sunblock.<br><br>Simon, will you do my back?<br><br>- No.<br>- No?!<br><br>- I don't want to touch you.<br>- Unbelievable.<br><br>Fine, I'll do it myself.<br><br>Look all right,<br>I'll do it with one finger.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>You've got too much here.<br>And here. I'll scrape it off.<br><br>OK, but don't try and be funny and draw<br>a cock on my back or something.<br><br>No, course not.<br><br>Right, all done.<br><br>See, that wasn't so bad, was it?<br><br>No, that was fine.<br><br>I was really enjoying my book,<br><br>blissfully unaware of the crudely drawn<br>phallus burning itself onto my skin.<br><br>Meanwhile, Jay was having trouble<br>with his emergency funds.<br><br>- Are you all right?<br>- Yeah, it's just that 20 euros.<br><br>Ay-oh, Jay, here we go,<br>we've been spotted.<br><br>Seen 'em.<br><br>Look cool.<br><br>Manchester.<br><br>Manchester!<br><br>- Who's this little twat?<br>- You from Manchester?<br><br>You like Manchester?<br><br>- Yeah, yeah. Near Manchester.<br>- No, you aren't.<br><br>Shut up, Neil,<br>the birds are loving it.<br><br>- Goal!<br>- Goal!<br><br>Goal to Manchester! Yeah!<br><br>No. Manchester, down.<br><br>Yeah, hilarious.<br>Now, get out the way.<br><br>Whoa!<br><br>Right. You're fucking dead,<br>you little shit!<br><br>Mate, just leave it, the chicas<br>are looking, just laugh it off.<br><br>No, I'm fine for drinks, thanks.<br><br>Oh! Alison. Hello!<br><br>Hello. You know you've got<br>a spunking cock on your back?<br><br>What?<br><br>Oh, no.<br>Thanks, Simon, very funny,<br><br>very mature. So I've been lying here<br>with a cock on my back, have I?<br><br>Not for the first time.<br><br>I'll burn a muff on my tit if it makes<br>you feel less self-conscious.<br><br>It would, actually.<br>We'd make quite the pair.<br><br>You've got a really good spot here.<br><br>Yes, Jay, um...<br>sort of, um...<br><br>Did he use some of his boyish charm?<br><br>In a way, yes.<br><br>I think I might start drinking again.<br>Anyone fancy joining me?<br><br>Um, yes, I will!<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Lucky me<br><br>Oh, I'm knackered.<br><br>- Fishbowl hangover?<br>- No. Nicos was over last night.<br><br>Does not stop talking.<br><br>No, we were having sex.<br><br>Right.<br><br>Sorry, does it make you uncomfortable<br>when I mention sex?<br><br>No! No, it's good,<br>it's great that you're so...<br><br>sexually active.<br><br>Yeah, I suppose it is.<br><br>- What's the best sex you've had, Will?<br>- Well, um... hard to say, really.<br><br>Come on, you can tell me.<br><br>Oh! I don't like to sex and tell.<br><br>Don't be boring, just tell me.<br><br>Look, I'm going to level with you,<br><br>I have never...<br>put my penis in a lady.<br><br>That's all right, you're a virgin,<br>that's cool.<br><br>It's definitely not cool.<br>If anything, it's famously uncool.<br><br>Well, it's cute, then.<br><br>Oh, God, that's even worse.<br><br>- You're funny, Will.<br>- Well, that's something.<br><br>Can I get a girl into bed for sex<br>just by making her laugh?<br><br>Course you can.<br><br>Wow! Great.<br><br>If she's a clinical moron.<br><br>Lucy, it's so amazing to see you.<br><br>What a welcome.<br>Nice to see you too.<br><br>Yeah. Good. Now, can you<br>still get boat party tickets?<br><br>I'd have thought so,<br>I'd just have to go and find the rep.<br><br>So are you coming along, then?<br><br>Yeah, course. It'll be amazing.<br><br>Great.<br><br>Cos Carli's here. In Malia.<br><br>And she's going to be<br>on the boat tomorrow.<br><br>If I can just get five minutes<br>alone with her,<br><br>I know we'll fix things up, it's fate.<br><br>So, can you go and get those tickets?<br><br>You really know how<br>to make a girl feel special, don't you?<br><br>Yeah. Yeah, I know.<br><br>Carli is going to love it.<br><br>Can you hurry up?<br><br>Simon's plan was coming together.<br><br>Meanwhile, Jane was about to experience<br>the full force of Jay's boyish charm.<br><br>Can you move? You're blocking the sun.<br><br>Charming!<br><br>What's happened to your face, Jay?<br><br>It's a food allergy.<br><br>I could do with one of those,<br>maybe an iced-bun allergy.<br><br>Yeah.

I said, ""Where's our towels?""<br><br>Now, there's no need to be abusive.<br><br>If you look around,<br>there are signs everywhere<br><br>saying you can't reserve sunbeds.<br><br>So you moved our towels?<br><br>The point I'm making is,<br>whatever the fate of the towels,<br><br>these cannot be your beds.<br><br>What have you done<br>with my fucking towels?!<br><br>Sir, I get you nice other beds.<br>Please, take up your stuff.<br><br>Me?!

Yeah, me too.<br><br>Totally naked.<br><br>Are they really going skinny dipping?<br><br>- If I know Jane, probably, yeah.<br>- Really?<br><br>- Fucking hell, really?!<br>- Yes.<br><br>And...<br><br>...what about you?<br><br>Well, I'm meeting Nicos in half an hour.<br><br>Course.<br><br>So I reckon I've got time<br>for a quick dip.<br><br>Obviously, Alison and me<br>was never going to happen.<br><br>And yet, and yet...<br><br>No, I had no fucking chance.<br><br>Come on. What are you doing?<br><br>Get it off.<br><br>No, yeah. Good.

I don't know.<br><br>OK.<br><br>Take your clothes off.<br><br>That's it till next year, I'm afraid!<br><br>I've lost my glasses.<br><br>I've lost my glasses!<br><br>God, it's freezing in here.<br><br>Don't be such a wuss.<br><br>Ah!<br><br>That's right,<br>let's get someone's hair wet, shall we?<br><br>It always looks wet anyway, gel-boy.<br><br>Right, how's this for a wet look, then?<br><br>Oh, shit, sorry.<br><br>Carli!<br><br>Carli, over here!<br><br>Carli, over here!

Are you getting out?<br><br>- Yes.<br>- That was Carli, did you see her?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>It was dark, but I saw her.<br><br>Isn't she beautiful?<br><br>Yes, she's very beautiful.<br><br>I'm going now.<br><br>Oh. OK!<br><br>- All right?<br>- I've been better.<br><br>- What are you doing?<br>- I'm thinking.<br><br>About how shit the holiday is?<br><br>Partly that. Partly I'm thinking<br>about putting stones in my pockets<br><br>and chucking myself in the pool.<br><br>Oh, I wouldn't swim in that, it's rank.<br><br>Right.<br><br>Also, if you put stones in your pockets,<br><br>you'll sink, so... better to not<br>have the stones, really.<br><br>I'll bear that in mind, Neil.<br><br>I stopped believing in God when<br>I realised it was just ""dog"" backwards.<br><br>What?<br><br>Well, when you think about it...<br>G/O/D, D/O/G.<br><br>It's like an anagram,<br>but a backwards one, innit?<br><br>Right.<br><br>And then, after that,<br>I just stopped worrying about stuff.<br><br>You only get one go round, I reckon.<br>When you're dead, you're dead.<br><br>So you can spend your time thinking<br>about how things haven't gone perfect<br><br>or you can just get on with it,<br>have a laugh and that.<br><br>That's what I do, I'm pretty happy.<br><br>You are, aren't you?<br><br>Yeah!<br><br>Thanks, Neil.

I thought I'd surprise you.<br><br>- Oh, well.<br>- You what... You tore them up?!<br><br>- Yeah.<br>- What, after we had the fight?<br><br>Yeah, I... I was angry<br>'cos you had a go, and that.<br><br>Yeah, no...<br><br>Makes sense.<br><br>You two go on,<br><br>I'm just going to have<br>a little recovery snooze.<br><br>Come on, mate,<br>you can have my bed tonight,<br><br>this one's a bit bitey.<br><br>Did I tell you I touched a boob tonight?<br><br>Like... Like a real boob.<br><br>A girl's one.<br>I didn't get to lick it, though.<br><br>This has been the best night of my life.<br><br>It was the day of the boat party,<br><br>and it looked like literally<br>everyone in Malia had a ticket.<br><br>Well, everyone except me and Simon,<br><br>whose mood was now bluer than his balls.<br><br>If I could, I'd give you my ticket, Si.<br><br>You can, just give me your ticket.<br><br>Yeah, but I really want to go,<br>so you see, actually, I can't.<br><br>- Take Jay's ticket.<br>- No, I think he needs it.<br><br>What, cos of Jane?<br><br>No, in case the captain dies<br>and they need me to drive the boat.<br><br>Eased up on the vomiting,<br>mainly retching now.<br><br>For the record, they don't clean<br>that toilet floor very often,<br><br>lots of pubes on hands, knees...<br>and my face<br><br>when I had a little lie-down.<br>I cannot believe we've been eating here.<br><br>Wow, they look hot!<br><br>- Bit young for you, ain't they, Neil?<br>- Behave.<br><br>Lucy. Lucy!<br><br>Alison! Aliso...<br>Oh. I give up.<br><br>All right, boys? Who killed Will?<br><br>- What's up with Lucy?<br>- I don't know.<br><br>If you ask her rather than<br>talking about your ex the whole time,<br><br>- you might find out.<br>- Oh, God, really?<br><br>Fine.<br><br>- You coming to the boat party, then?<br>- You try and stop me.<br><br>We just saw two hot fellas<br>dressed as firemen getting on board.<br><br>Might need a hand with their hoses.<br><br>Might have to set fire to my knickers.<br><br>- I'll come with you, if you like.<br>- No, thank you.<br><br>Come on, Lisa.<br><br>You look as bad on the outside<br>as I feel on the inside.<br><br>Oh, don't worry,<br>I feel like shit on the inside too.<br><br>Although...<br><br>I don't have a pube on my cheek.<br><br>Oh, God.<br><br>Anyway, seeing you in such a mess<br>has at least cheered me up a bit.<br><br>Glad to be of service.<br><br>You know I have a penis<br>sunburnt on my back too.<br><br>Must be reassuring to know<br>that however bad life gets,<br><br>you're not me.<br><br>It is.<br><br>Good. That means every time you're down,<br>you have to come and hang out with me.<br><br>Yeah, I think I might.<br><br>Starting with today.<br><br>I've got Nicos's ticket for the boat<br>party. Do you fancy joining me?<br><br>Um, yes.<br><br>More than anything.<br><br>Great. On one condition, though.<br><br>Anything.<br><br>At no point are you allowed<br>to say, ""I told you so"".<br><br>Ooh, not sure I can guarantee that.<br><br>So it's not that I'd rather go<br>to a party that infinitely heightens<br><br>my sense of being out of kilter<br>with the rest of the world,<br><br>it's just that Alison is sort of<br>the fittest girl I've ever met<br><br>- and maybe...<br>- It's fine, Will, honestly.<br><br>Go for it, I'll just find a quiet spot<br>and hang myself.<br><br>Great. Lucy, make sure<br>he doesn't hang himself.<br><br>I'm off. Look at me,<br>following my cock like a normal person.<br><br>Sorry for saying cock.<br><br>I didn't realise<br>I was being such a dick.<br><br>You were.<br><br>- I'm trying to say sorry.<br>- Well, say it, then.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>For being a dick.<br><br>Sorry for being a dick.<br><br>And for having too much gel<br>in your hair.<br><br>I don't think I've got that much...<br><br>OK, I'm sorry for having<br>too much gel in my hair.<br><br>You should probably get going.<br><br>I'm not that bothered.<br><br>Really?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>If you like, maybe we could hang out,<br>the two of us.<br><br>I quite fancy just staying by the pool.<br><br>Yeah, I mean, why spend the day<br>having unbelievable fun on the party boat<br><br>when you could be taking a depressed man<br>swimming at a family hotel?<br><br>I'm serious.<br><br>I don't mind.<br><br>I might even cheer you up...<br><br>if they let you back in.<br><br>I honestly don't think<br>I'll be very good company,<br><br>but thanks for the offer.<br><br>You go, I'll be all right.<br><br>Look...<br><br>it's obvious how much<br>Carli means to you.<br><br>She's lucky...<br><br>I think.<br><br>I'm sure you'll sort it out.<br><br>She goes back tomorrow.<br>I can feel her slipping away.<br><br>Simon...<br><br>if she really means that much to you,<br><br>I want you to take my ticket.<br><br>Lucy...<br><br>If you really want to go, take it.<br><br>If you really want to go.<br><br>God, you'd do that for me?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>I'll see you later,<br>enjoy the pool!

I'll keep this, yeah?<br><br>No problemo.<br><br>I think the Government's<br>anti-drugs campaign<br><br>would be more successful<br>if they pointed out<br><br>that every now and again,<br><br>there's a small chance you might<br>accidentally snort some poo.<br><br>Simon?<br><br>- Are you all right?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Yeah, for the first time in my life,<br>I think I actually am.<br><br>I'm clear, anyway.<br><br>How'd it go with Carli?<br><br>Long term - good. Short term - horrific.<br><br>Have you murdered her?<br><br>No, but I am starting to think<br>that maybe Carli's not all that.<br><br>Well, it's taken a while.<br><br>- Better late than never.<br>- I think Lucy might be the one.<br><br>Yes, obviously.<br><br>Lucy's much nicer<br>and actually likes you.<br><br>But I'm worried I might have been<br>a bit of a dick to her.<br><br>You've been more<br>than a bit of a dick to her.<br><br>You've been a massive dick<br>to her.<br><br>- She still likes you, anyway.<br>- Good,<br><br>that's really good.<br><br>Does he always strip when he's happy?<br><br>Yeah, normally.<br><br>Simon!<br>You can't go up there, there's a sign.<br><br>Oh, sign<br><br>Alison, will you text Lucy<br>and tell her I'm coming to get her?<br><br>Course I will.<br><br>Brilliant!<br><br>All right?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>What are you doing up there, then?<br><br>I'm going to swim back to shore<br>and tell Lucy how I feel.<br><br>How romantic.<br><br>It is, isn't it?<br><br>Is it a bit far?<br><br>Nah, bollocks. You can see the shore.<br><br>I've swum further than that underwater.<br><br>Do it!

Is this kid your former student?<br><br>I'm not her mentor. <br>We're just companions on the rooftop.<br><br>What's that?<br><br>Is she really a good teacher? <br>Is there no problem?<br><br>There's absolutely no problem. <br>The students really like her.<br><br>The students like me, right?<br><br>What do they like about her?<br><br>What do they like... Ah, <br>she makes the students carry condoms.<br><br>Is that true?<br><br>The parents would be shocked, right?<br><br>It caused a commotion. I even <br>bought them out of my own pocket.<br><br>But it's all because the adults <br>didn't teach them properly.<br><br>I told them to carry them <br>for their own protection.<br><br>But then the parents had the school <br>dismiss me.

Are you staying at the<br>hotel in front of the train station today?<br><br>You found a new boyfriend so quickly?<br><br>What are you laughing at?<br><br>- Let's make it more lasting <br>this time.

There won't be <br>any problems this time.<br><br>But every time a man comes, <br>I'll kick you out.<br><br>You're like a mother who abuses her child.<br><br>Goodbye.<br><br>Teacher Moriko is excellent, <br>just unlucky in choosing boyfriends.<br><br>She falls in love as soon as <br>she hears sweet words,<br><br>and then she gets dumped quickly.<br><br>This movie isn't particularly tear-jerking,<br><br>but the scene where the two dancers <br>are abandoned by the same man,<br><br>she cries every time she sees it. <br>I really like that about her.<br><br>Oh? Did the teacher work <br>in the film industry in Tokyo?<br><br>Yes, distribution. It means buying <br>movies to screen in theaters.<br><br>Oh, no wonder there are so <br>many movie DVDs in her room.<br><br>Yes, but that company<br> went bankrupt in five years.<br><br>And then my father, <br>whom I cut ties with...<br><br>Cut ties?<br><br>He was an abusive alcoholic, a lousy dad <br>who forced his kids to give him money.<br><br>He found my address,<br><br>came to my door demanding money, <br>and it infuriated me.<br><br>I wanted to cut him off completely, <br>so I gave him all my savings.<br><br>At that time, my boyfriend said he wanted <br>to go back to his hometown in Minamisoma,<br><br>so I followed him, hoping <br>to force him to marry me.<br><br>You already had<br> a teaching certificate back then?<br><br>Yes, I wanted to teach in the countryside, <br>and I actually got hired.<br><br>My boyfriend and I broke up quickly,<br><br>and unexpectedly, <br>I found joy in being a teacher.<br><br>Then I got transferred to Koriyama.<br><br>What happened between<br>you and your father after that?<br><br>I haven't seen him in 10 years, I think.<br><br>My hometown is in rural Kyushu,<br><br>and I'm sure all the relatives and<br>neighbors are cursing me for being unfilial.<br><br>Why is it like that?<br><br>Many people believe blood is thicker than<br>water and that father and daughter can reconcile.<br><br>But that's just an illusion.<br><br>Come on,<br><br>hit me too. If you don't, let's end it.<br><br>Hello.<br><br>Hmm, she's is doing well. Don't worry.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Oh? Yes.<br><br>I understand how you feel, <br>but please understand your daughter...<br><br>She has her own life too...<br><br>But…<br><br>I see. I understand.

I really like Bao.<br><br>So... I haven't slept with Bao.<br><br>Huh?<br><br>I haven't had sex with Bao,<br>not even once.<br><br>-Not even once? <br>-Not even once.<br><br>There were several opportunities, actually.<br><br>But when I see his innocent and bright smile,<br><br>I can't go through with it. <br>If it was just for fun,<br><br>maybe, but he's so sincere.<br><br>I feel like it's not something I can do.<br><br>I feel like I need to protect his smile.<br><br>What are your feelings from that standpoint?<br><br>But does Bao know <br>about your feelings, teacher?<br><br>Well, I think he knows.<br><br>What are you doing, Bao? <br>Sleeping with the teacher.<br><br>-Yeah, we slept together. <br>-Slept together.<br><br>Is Bao having a cold?<br><br>-It's nothing. <br>-Take care of yourself.<br><br>By the way, <br>there's something I want to ask you.<br><br>In Minamisoma...<br><br>- Minamisoma? <br>-A place you have a deep connection with.<br><br>There's a movie theater called Asahi Cinema.<br><br>- Asahi Theater? <br>- Do you know about it?<br><br>It's an old movie theater <br>that's about to collapse.<br><br>When I was transferred to Minamisoma, <br>I used to go there all the time.<br><br>One day, I watched a film called <br>""Toto the Hero,"" you know?<br><br>Ah, directed by ""The Eighth Day""?<br><br>Yes, it's a gloomy film, <br>but it has a fantastic ending.<br><br>It's really good.<br><br>But the double feature that was <br>shown with it was ""The Mysterious Ghost Inn.""<br><br>It was the debut film by director Sugizuo Jitaro.<br><br>It was good in its own way,<br><br>but the two films didn't match at all, <br>so I argued with that old man.<br><br>old man?<br><br>He was the beer-bellied manager.<br><br>His selection of movies was a mess.<br><br>That theater is a good one. <br>When you have a long vacation,<br><br>I hope you go help them rebuild it.<br><br>I was actually saving money<br><br>to buy the theater after I retired.<br><br>I don't want that cinema to disappear<br><br>because back then, when I watched movies there,<br><br>it gave me the motivation to keep striving.<br><br>People can live without movies,<br><br>but there are many <br>who were saved by those images.<br><br>It would be too sad if such a place disappeared,<br> don't you think?<br><br>Later, the teacher seemed to improve a bit.<br><br>I visit her when I have time <br>and stay in Koriyama on weekends.<br><br>I thought she might recover like that.<br><br>When people are too close to each other, <br>things turn out like this...<br><br>Great movie.<br><br>Last month, I went to Taiwan <br>for the first time to buy the rights to a film.<br><br>I just confirmed that <br>it will be shown in a small theater in Tokyo.<br><br>Can Bao understand it?<br><br>He can't read many Chinese characters,<br><br>but he can grasp the meaning.<br><br>That's what makes a good movie.<br><br>Hmm? What's the matter?<br><br>You're very diligent.<br><br>No, I just managed to buy this one.<br><br>The first film Hamano managed to buy. <br>I really want to watch it in a theater.<br><br>Please come and watch it. <br>It must be watched in a movie theater.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Distribute all kinds of films<br><br>and show them to people all over Japan. <br>That's my dream.<br><br>Although that dream didn't come true,<br><br>I succeeded in turning <br>a lost girl into a movie lover.<br><br>Bao.<br><br>Hamano, don't you have to work?<br><br>You're asking the same question as the teacher. <br>I took a special day off.<br><br>I already got it all set up yesterday,<br>with a bunch of pipes.<br><br>I really like Mariko.<br><br>- But Mariko... hates me. <br>- Ah?<br><br>I said I liked her, loved her.<br><br>Every time I say it, <br>she just smiles and brushes it off.<br><br>But she actually hates me.<br><br>That's not true. <br>What are you talking about?<br><br>The teacher really likes Bao.<br><br>Maybe it's like... how should I put it...<br><br>She likes me as if I were her son.<br><br>Or maybe like a little dog or cat.<br><br>Just say it's not true.<br><br>Huh? So Bao married <br>the teacher because he likes her?<br><br>Of course. Why would <br>he get married if he didn't like her?<br><br>That's right. You're right.<br><br>Actually, it doesn't matter to me.<br><br>As long as Masako is with me, <br>it doesn't matter if I don't have residency rights.<br><br>But Mariko probably wants to...<br><br>She wants to leave an inheritance for me.<br><br>She's afraid that after she's gone,<br><br>her father will take the money.<br><br>Did you contact her father?<br><br>She said it's not possible. <br>She's very angry.<br><br>She never used to get angry before.<br><br>But Hamano, when you visit her,<br><br>she's very happy.<br><br>Mariko is gone.<br><br>If I stay in Japan... it's meaningless.<br><br>Marriage... is also meaningless.<br><br>I don't want money.<br><br>Bao!<br><br>Please say something to her at the end.<br><br>Teacher.<br><br>Teacher, can you hear me?<br><br>- Mariko. <br>- Teacher!<br><br>Teacher, Bao says he really likes you.<br><br>Did you hear that? <br>So, teacher, it's not unrequited love.<br><br>Teacher, your marriage isn't fake either.<br><br>Bao truly loves you, <br>that's why he married you.<br><br>Bao always says he likes you.<br><br>But you never respond to him, <br>which makes him very sad.<br><br>So, teacher,<br><br>Bao really likes you.<br><br>Teacher?<br><br>Really?<br><br>Really, really.<br><br>Bao!<br><br>Mariko, I like you. <br>I like you the most.<br><br>So...Bao...<br><br>Also likes me...<br><br>It's mutual...<br><br>We both like each other...<br><br>Yes, yes, it's mutual, teacher.<br><br>What the...?<br><br>What the...?<br><br>So that's how it is...<br><br>If I had known earlier...<br><br>Mariko?<br><br>At 8:24 in the evening, she left.<br><br>Mariko!<br><br>Teacher!<br><br>Her last words...<br><br>Last words...?<br><br>She said, ""If I had known earlier,<br><br>I would have done it,"" right?<br><br>Isn't that what she said?<br><br>Well, it could be expressed differently... <br>not like ""done it""...<br><br>What kind of final words are those?<br><br>What kind of Last words!<br><br>Say something nicer!<br><br>It's rare to hear... <br>such final words.<br><br>Very unique.<br><br>Indeed.<br><br>In the end, I accomplished nothing, <br>just caused trouble.<br><br>But I'm still happy about it.<br><br>- Old man. <br>- Oh.<br><br>Forget it.<br><br>What's the matter? Say it.<br><br>Do you still think that in the end, <br>blood ties are the most important?<br><br>I don't know. My wife left me, <br>and I don't have any children.<br><br>My younger brother also went ahead. <br>Sooner or later, I'll die alone.<br><br>I guess there's no way around it.<br><br>In the past, my family had good relationships.<br><br>A typical middle-class family, <br>you could say.<br><br>If it weren't for the disaster, <br>we would probably still get along well.<br><br>I would have lived carefree.<br><br>Then, I might have thought <br>that family is the most important.<br><br>In the end, family blood is thicker than water<br><br>But the disaster happened, <br>it just had to happen.<br><br>There's no going back to <br>how things were before it happened.<br><br>So... since the earthquake.<br><br>I stopped believing in family bonds.<br><br>Aunt Hideko said at that time,<br><br>""Even if locals know that family is an illusion,<br><br>they still find solace in it.""<br><br>Although I felt that might be true,<br><br>if it's an illusion,<br><br>the despair of seeing through <br>the illusion is immeasurable.<br><br>so…<br><br>Rather than finding solace in an illusion,<br><br>I want to build a community <br>that doesn't require illusions.<br><br>I think that ideal has more hope.<br><br>I completely agree with that statement.<br><br>So, I initially thought of using <br>the cinema to achieve it.<br><br>But my approach was wrong.<br><br>Instead of desperately trying to preserve <br>the cinema for dignity's sake,<br><br>I should have thought about <br>how to incorporate the cinema into a new building.<br><br>That way it wouldn't be so boring.<br>Without a cinema like this,<br><br>people would think that cinemas always exist, <br>so they don't cherish them.<br><br>It's the same everywhere. People only feel <br>regret when something is about to be demolished<br><br>It's better than nobody feeling regret, right?<br><br>That's true.<br><br>It's the same with people. <br>You can't always see the person you love.<br><br>You never know when they'll disappear. <br>Nobody can predict it.<br><br>It's hard to understand this kind of thing, <br>no matter how many failures you have.<br><br>""Write it down as a reflection on life!""<br><br>Sigh. Can the construction <br>suddenly stop miraculously?<br><br>Just like in the movies.<br><br>We say things like that, <br>and then it actually happens...<br><br>Let's go grab a meal.<br><br>Sure.<br><br>what's wrong? Why are you in such a hurry? <br>It'll shorten your lifespan, you know.<br><br>No, I can't die yet!<br><br>Hey! Hey!<br><br>The construction has been canceled!<br><br>-Oh? <br>-Halted! It's been halted!<br><br>What's going on?<br><br>Here's what happened...<br><br>It's just... you see...<br><br>It didn't convey the meaning properly.<br><br>Did you manage to raise the money?<br><br>I can't believe you... Oh!?<br><br>And what about this place...?<br><br>No problem anymore.<br><br>That's great.<br><br>Sadao has been negotiating <br>with the other party persistently.<br><br>-Ah sada! <br>-No, no, no...<br><br>I came up with an idea.<br><br>Even if we don't demolish this place, <br>there are still other lands.<br><br>So I introduced them to some cheap vacant lots.<br><br>But if they couldn't come up with the money, <br>it wouldn't work.<br><br>But the townspeople donated money to us.<br><br>Hideko donated a large sum, <br>and together with the public, it's 4.5 million.<br><br>The rest... Oh? Ah, over there! Come on!<br><br>Bao! ?<br><br>- Long time no see. <br>- Why are you here?<br><br>I saw the news and <br>recognized your face on Instagram.<br><br>But the name wasn't quite right...<br><br>But the last two characters were <br>the same as Mariko's.<br><br>So I immediately understood.<br><br>""Mariko"" was the first Chinese character I learned.<br><br>This person donated 5 million.<br><br>Mariko's gift to me.<br><br>I'm going back to Vietnam to open a cinema.<br><br>That will require money.<br><br>It's okay, there's still some left. <br>I'll work hard.<br><br>I'll probably only be able to build a small cinema.<br><br>That's amazing.<br><br>And also,<br><br>I need to ask you a favor.<br><br>I've placed Mariko's ashes in a temple.<br>Mariko said she wanted them scattered in the sea.<br><br>When I return after opening the cinema <br>in my country, I'll come back again.<br><br>Please protect her remains for me.<br><br>I understand. I promise you.<br><br>Bao, thank you.<br><br>Bao, may I borrow her photo to see?<br><br>Of course.<br><br>Oh? Who is this person...?<br><br>Teacher Mariko Tanaka.<br><br>Bao's wife and my mentor.<br><br>She taught in Minamisoma, <br>so she also came here.<br><br>Ah I see!<br><br>The one who complained about our <br>double feature being awful!<br><br>Old man, this combination just doesn't work.<br><br>Nagging. <br>A good movie is a good combination.<br><br>Emotions will cancel each other out, <br>like mixing seafood with hamburgers.<br><br>It'll upset your stomach. <br>You just don't get it.<br><br>It's called a dream match, like a wrestling match<br> between Antonio Inoki and Muhammad Ali.<br><br>It only feels like a dream <br>when it doesn't happen.<br><br>Didn't we learn a lesson from <br>the mess between Inoki and Ali?<br><br>Last month, we had ""Eternal Day"" <br>paired with ""Peking Man.""<br><br>What mood do you expect me to go home with?<br><br>I liked both of them. <br>Why don't you pair them?<br><br>Fine, old man, listen carefully.<br><br>If it were me, I'd do it like this.<br><br>I'd try out her combination and see how <br>it plays out. And the audience lined up for miles.<br><br>I wanted to ask her again, <br>but she never came back.<br><br>That was probably when <br>she was transferred to Koriyama.<br><br>The expressions of the audience leaving were<br> completely different—filled with satisfaction.<br><br>Everyone looked confused <br>when I finished setting it up.<br><br>How did you manage to set it up?<br><br>Oh, so it was her...<br><br>Bao, thank you.<br><br>But what about the remaining amount?<br><br>The other party told me not to reveal <br>their identity under any circumstances.<br><br>It's Hinano Asahi Transportation Company.<br><br>Thank you so much...<br><br>Really?<br><br>Anyway, it's a cause for celebration.<br><br>That's great!<br><br>Thank you, everyone.<br><br>- That's great! <br>- Yes!<br><br>- That's great, isn't it? <br>- Thank you, everyone...<br><br>Are you leaving tomorrow?<br><br>Hey.<br><br>Hey.<br><br>Oh, what's up?<br><br>Um...<br><br>Thank you for the money.<br><br>I'll repay you in the future.<br><br>No need to repay. <br>I didn't do it as a father.<br><br>You can't do that.<br><br>My mom and I went to that theater <br>when we were traveling before.<br><br>ah?<br><br>We drove by there.<br><br>Mom said it's rare to pass by, <br>so let's watch a movie.<br><br>The ticket usher was a man.<br><br>So I have a vivid impression.<br><br>He said it was a horror movie, <br>perfect for a couple on a date.<br><br>- General Manager <br>- I'll be right there.<br><br>Goodbye, Asahi. Take care.<br><br>Is it really okay? The general manager <br>is driving himself.<br><br>The situation is critical now.<br><br>If there are no passengers, <br>we have to do everything from cargo to errands.<br><br>- After the storm comes the calm. <br>Let's go! - Okay.<br><br>Thank you all so much.<br><br>- Keep up the good work. <br>- Thanks, boss.<br><br>Thank you, Chairman. <br>You helped me a lot.<br><br>The real test has just begun.<br><br>Bao,<br><br>thank you so much.<br><br>Goodbye.<br><br>- See you another day. <br>- Thank you.<br><br>- Keep up the good work. <br>- Thank you.<br><br>Let's go eat.<br><br>Old man.<br><br>I've decided to stay here.<br><br>Aren't you going back to Tokyo?<br><br>Preserving the Asahi Theater <br>doesn't mean a perfect ending.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>And if I leave, won't you feel lonely? <br>Stop pretending!<br><br>Who would feel lonely? I have full control <br>over the movie lineup. It's paradise.<br><br>In the end, that's why you failed.<br><br>But...<br><br>not everything can be judged as right or wrong.<br><br>- About the large bathhouse? <br>- Yes.<br><br>That person from Company I<br><br>was also trying to do the right thing <br>for the town and its residents<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>I don't know if this result <br>is really considered good.<br><br>All we can do is work hard from <br>now on so as not to let this day down.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>We can only manage <br>the theater like growing good rice.<br><br>We'll definitely encounter failures as well.<br><br>Sometimes you say something sensible.<br><br>Old man, your days are numbered, <br>but I still have a bright future.<br><br>You should really change <br>your habit of being sarcastic.<br><br>What do you want to eat?<br><br>What should we eat?<br><br>Teacher, how are you doing over there?<br><br>We went through some hardships here, <br>and this is the result.<br><br>- What are you doing? Take a look over there.<br>- What?<br><br>Even without psychic abilities, I can tell.<br><br>He's filled with an ominous aura <br>as if he's about to die.<br><br>Seems suspicious.<br><br>Do you want to play a scene?<br><br>- A scene? <br>- To stop him from committing suicide.<br><br>The plot is that you stole money from a guest.<br><br>- What a rotten person. <br>- Don't you want to act?<br><br>Of course I do. <br>It sounds interesting.<br><br>If I'm just overthinking, that's fine too. <br>I'll go to the projection room.<br><br>What about the character setting?<br><br>Just play yourself.<br><br>Play myself?<br><br>Play yourself, huh...<br><br>Maybe one day, someone <br>will be saved here by a phantom image.<br><br>Even if it's just one person, <br>I want to hold on until that day comes.<br><br>A brooding yet kind-hearted film enthusiast,<br><br>moved to tears despite the darkness.</div>",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Hama_no_asahi_no_usotsukidomo_to-16979594

<br><br>Nothing, dear.<br><br>I thought the leaf of waist will fall, <br>but, here it's the head which is falling.<br><br>What happened?<br><br>The whole thing is stupid.<br>the movie, the process...<br><br>...people like you who are sitting and enjoying! <br>I'm disgusted by the whole thing.<br><br>See, it's just an ash print.<br>Not the whole film.<br><br>Yeah, by the way, Arun...<br>this is Manju, art director.<br><br>This is Arun, director of the film.<br><br>Just how a person with monkey <br>make it dance and earn money...<br><br>...you are earning by <br>making women dance?<br><br>You see, Miss...<br><br>Shit. Only now I introduced Manju to you.<br><br>You are forgetful on women's matter.<br><br>See, Miss Manju. It's just <br>a part of my documentary.<br><br>Actually, my documentary is based on women.<br><br>Why? Beedi, cigarettes,<br>soap are getting boring?<br><br>See, this is purely business. They <br>make films based on the market.<br><br>And, market will always <br>be there for women.<br><br>So, you're saying, women are <br>equivalent to selling goods?<br><br>See, Miss Manju. I am not making <br>this film to insult or humiliate women.<br><br>Actually, I sympathise <br>with the Cabaret Dancer.<br><br>I am angry on those, who <br>are harassing her like this.<br><br>Using my documentary. I...<br><br>Hey, hey, hey... Stop, man.<br><br>Let me finish my work and leave.<br><br>Then, it's between you and Manju.<br><br>Look, Manju.

Okay?<br><br>Awkward joke.<br><br>What is your film based on?<br><br>About awkwardness.<br><br>I mean about women's.<br><br>The title of the film is <br>'One Half of the Whole Sky.'<br><br>If our society is a sky, <br>the half of it is women.<br><br>The title seems to be a poetry.<br><br>Have you keep it so that everyone <br>gets hooked by the title itself?<br><br>No, there is a purpose of this title. The <br>title isn't a bait for others to get hooked.<br><br>I have some ideas on present<br>days situation around women.<br><br>- As example. We're thinking<br>women as slave... - Best of luck.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Do you believe, you can change every<br>women's situation with your one film?<br><br>Tying a girl in bath towel with...<br><br>...a soap in hand, if you believe <br>soap will sold out, then...<br><br>No.<br><br>It's not my belief. <br>It's Soap company's.<br><br>- Whatever it is, I'm saying...<br>- That's all right.<br><br>What do you want me to do now?<br><br>At first, let's not talk like <br>strangers, okay?

For that, <br>I have to do makeup and all, is it?<br><br>Yes. The makeup you do everyday <br>for the society, that's enough.<br><br>Okay, okay.<br><br>Mm... wait.<br><br>Come. Move the chair.<br>I don't need it here.<br><br>Place madam in the centre.<br><br>Okay, ready? I'll ask questions which<br>you have to answer on the mic.<br><br>Don't look at camera. It doesn't look <br>natural. You talk as usual, okay?<br><br>Camera ready?<br><br>Light, fan.<br><br>Start.<br><br>How many woman are <br>there in your protection?<br><br>Approximately, 25 women.<br><br>What type of woman are you allowing?<br><br>Those who did crimes.<br><br>The place is for those, <br>who failed in their lives.<br><br>Alright.<br><br>While you kept them alone or seperate...<br><br>...have you noticed any change in<br>their thoughts to do crime?<br><br>Coffee is here, take it.<br><br>No problem. Let us drink afterwards.<br><br>Okay. Is there any motive for <br>you to do the social service?<br><br>What motive do you expect me to have?<br><br>I have a soul desire in this.<br><br>So, if your soul desire<br>has to be continued...<br><br>...many woman have to continue<br>failing in their lives, isn't it?<br><br>How many children do you have?<br><br>Two son's and two daughter's.<br><br>What do they think<br>about your service?<br><br>- They are proud of my service.<br>- Is it?<br><br>Will you permit your son to <br>marry a girl from your trust?<br><br>I always believe in freedom<br>of an independent person.<br><br>They should take their <br>own decisions in life.<br><br>I am very determined on that.<br><br>Very convenient answer.<br><br>Why? Don't you feel it or do your <br>son's don't believe in reformation?<br><br>At least, it's enough to treat women<br>of your house without any degration.<br><br>Excuse me, a small question finally.<br><br>What do you think of your job?<br><br>It's not a job. It's a service.<br><br>To bring prosper &amp; justice to the society...<br><br>...four good hearted people...<br><br>Cut it.<br><br>You should've been there.<br><br>Her sweat of shame on face<br>would've filled four buckets.<br><br>From your words, Arun seems <br>to be very mischievous.<br><br>No, no.<br><br>Nothing like that. But, he <br>is a different character.<br><br>From the questions he asked, <br>I understood, he had clear ideas on it.<br><br>So, you liked Arun very much?<br><br>I see you frequently with him.<br><br>Nothing doing. He invited me for <br>a coffee, soon after the interview.<br><br>I replied, I am going home &amp; left the place.<br><br>Why?<br><br>I know, what he is going to ask next.<br><br>While drinking coffee, <br>he will ask about me.<br><br>Then, without waiting for my question, <br>he will say about himself.<br><br>Unknowingly, his hand will fall on me.<br><br>His foot will rub me.<br><br>Why bother to these nonsense!<br><br>I don't know how you can act like this?<br><br>You behave like children, who put<br>moustache on face before sleep.<br><br>It's okay. You have no faith on men.<br><br>So, helping on his film <br>is past tense from today?<br><br>No, no. That will go on it's way.<br><br>Helping is one thing. <br>Rubbing is another. Isn't it?<br><br>I think I am giving you a lot of trouble.<br><br>No.<br><br>If not this, I would've been <br>doing something else.<br><br>One minute, I am coming.<br>Make yourself comfortable.<br><br>Don't worry. You cook yourself &amp; eat?<br><br>Where are your parents?<br><br>My parents are in Coimbatore.<br><br>Father is a businessman.<br><br>Okay, where is your family?<br><br>My father is... Mother is in Paris.<br>Father is also there in embassy.<br><br>Are you living here alone?<br><br>No, no. l am with my cousin.<br><br>Why didn't you go to Paris?<br><br>I can go, If I wish. But, I like it here.<br><br>Okay, you will drink coffee, right?<br><br>What else can we do here?<br><br>Let's drink coffee.<br><br>Are you a communist?<br><br>Why?<br><br>You have kept Marx book.<br><br>I wish to know everything.<br>So, I read this.<br><br>Why? If I am communist, what's wrong in it?<br><br>I hate the red colour.<br><br>It should be your eye's problem.<br><br>You will earn lot of money<br>by making a film, isn't it?<br><br>That's not my only aim.<br><br>Having an unusual proffession<br>become a fashion nowdays.<br><br>- I believe in my work.<br>- I don't believe you.<br><br>Okay. Sunday, we are <br>going to meet Janaki.<br><br>- Janaki? <br>- Playback Singer.<br><br>- Oh...<br>- Bye.<br><br>What are you thinking, buddy?<br><br>Is it about any woman?<br><br>No, no.<br><br>When a man is alone, he will<br>think of a lady or his own luck.<br><br>What are you thinking about?<br>Surely, it can't be about women.<br><br>Not about a lady, but about ladies.<br>Because they always gets cheated.<br><br>Hey, buddy.<br><br>I don't know about liberty <br>or equality. But, one thing.<br><br>Two things should be <br>tasted and appreciated.<br><br>One is Wine.<br>The other is Women.<br><br>Be it by birth, or in habits <br>or even in the bedroom...<br><br>...men &amp; women can never be equal.<br><br>Specifically in bedroom,<br>there is no room for equality.<br><br>See, it's useless arguing with you.<br>You are a prejudiced ass.<br><br>Yes, I am a Male ass.<br><br>Okay, leave it. How is your<br>your documentary work.<br><br>Then, how's Manju?<br>Is she helping you nice?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Proceeding well.<br><br>Manju is innocent. She is having<br>some disturbance in her mind.<br><br>I think the reason behind <br>her critical behaviour is...<br><br>...caused by some misery of her past.<br><br>Hey, buddy. A bad bag spoiling<br>a good subject. Don't you know?<br><br>Mother went behind other men. Daughter<br>and father tolerates her to certain extent.<br><br>When the opportunity struck, the man divorce her.<br><br>Then, how? How could Manju be happy?<br><br>What? Whom are you talking about?<br><br>All about your Manju's history. Too stinky.<br><br>Why Manju didn't marry?<br><br>Hey, who will marry her?<br><br>It's for people with stable mind. She is unstable.<br><br>Try discussing marriage with her. She <br>will say, she has no faith in such drama.<br><br>- Oh.<br>- Hey, hey, hey...<br><br>Why do you bother about it?<br><br>Look. Women and Politicians <br>belong to same category.<br><br>They will go to any extent to achieve their goal.<br><br>But, they don't know what their goal is.<br><br>See, buddy. Be careful. Okay, forget it.<br><br>Today, there is a hot film in<br>the film society. Interested?<br><br>No, thanks. You proceed.<br><br>Do this. There's a religious film playing<br>in Kamadhenu theatre. Go &amp; watch it.<br><br>You think your youth will always be <br>with you? Play when your are capable.<br><br>Go, man.<br><br>Wonderful... design! Manju, you are beautiful. <br>Your design gets influenced by it.<br><br>You know? When you first <br>time came here for a job...<br><br>I didn't see your certificates. Your body... <br>Sorry! I see your face. It's enough for a job.<br><br>Normally, I like women very much.<br><br>Wheather they are children, or youth,<br>if they look beautiful, l just love them.<br><br>Sir, put the signature.<br><br>Pen...?<br><br>I like women when they are angry too...<br><br>One thing. Don't think I have <br>crass, cheap opinion on girls.<br><br>In the world, two things you<br>have to handle very carefully.<br><br>One is Women.<br>The other is Culture.<br><br>By the way, I met Arun now.<br><br>He said, you are helping him nicely.<br><br>I told him to interact with you<br>without any fear or hesitation.<br><br>I think the film's output will be <br>interesting. You like it too, isn't it?<br><br>I don't like it.<br><br>Me too.<br><br>Boring thing means the documentary,<br>if it shows, I'll get out for a smoke.<br><br>Not like that, I like documentary <br>films, but the way they make it...<br><br>- What they say? - Taking method.<br>- I don't like the taking method.<br><br>But, Mr. Arun's subject is too good,<br>we have to congratulate him for that.<br><br>Congratulate him then.<br><br>Oh, Manju. Will you discuss<br>whatever we spoke here with Arun?<br><br>Should I?<br><br>Nothing like that.<br><br>I also felt after watching<br>Arun's documentary...<br><br>...there is no safety for <br>women in our country.<br><br>If a man has willpower and money,<br>to safeguard more than one lady...<br><br>...then the law should allow the <br>man to marry more than one lady.<br><br>They are talking about <br>Monogamy &amp; all... no, no, no!<br><br>That's practically impossible. <br>Too hard. They say it for sake.<br><br>Don't think, I am talking in a sex motive.<br><br>Sir, firstly, do your first marriage.<br><br>He is not even worth of first marriage...<br><br>...and talking on polygamy, <br>you're thinking? Okay, leave.<br><br>Look, you can't fool me.<br><br>I heard your comments.<br><br>I care a foot for your comments.<br><br>When I see someone speaking <br>at the back of anyone, I feel hasty.<br><br>Like the coward who<br>writes in the bathroom.<br><br>If you have guts, come and<br>talk to me straightly.<br><br>""She walks wearing stylish saree.""<br>""She wanders with dozen men.""<br><br>""She talks freely about sex.""<br><br>These are your topic, isn't it?<br><br>Whatever dress I wear,<br>it suits me. What can I do?<br><br>If you have three children and done<br>30 abortion and can't wear anything...<br><br>...so, you are jealous of me?<br><br>""She is talking freely about sex.""<br><br>Am I talking to have free sex?<br><br>Or, do you feel shame that I <br>don't discuss sex with you.<br><br>""She roams with many men."" <br>That's my wish.<br><br>If I wish, I will roam with your husband too...<br><br>You are insulting me. <br><br>I will go and report now <br>to the managing director.<br><br>Go with pleasure. He is <br>always behind me only.<br><br>Come. Wait for a minute.<br>Let me finish this.<br><br>What? Anger?<br><br>- One minute's anger will affect<br>entire day's happiness. - Look...<br><br>I hate living in ignorance.<br>I hate hypocrites.<br><br>I don't like people put on a mask.<br><br>They will talk like this. You should <br>ignore them. I would've done that.<br><br>If they will be like that<br>then, I will be like this.<br><br>You're going to face many difficulties.<br><br>I don't care.<br><br>I hate people who want honor...<br><br>...believing themselves above their worth.<br><br>So, you are saying that<br>you don't like yourself?<br><br>What do you mean?<br><br>Unwanted prestige, double life, double standard...<br><br>...believing themselves above <br>their worth &amp; all... suits you.<br><br>Shut up.<br><br>Or else, why would you sent <br>your parents to imaginary Paris?<br><br>Get away from here.<br><br>Hello, Arun.<br><br>Who is this?<br><br>Manju. Come fast to the news centre.<br><br>Manju, why do you call so late?<br><br>Anything wrong?<br><br>Yes. Are you coming?<br><br>Arun, if I say about myself,<br>even if the story seems bad...<br><br>...sometimes I think it <br>will be the utmost truth.<br><br>Arun, are you getting bored...<br><br>...coming here for me during midnight?<br><br>No. Why are you thinking something<br>and talking in some other ways?<br><br>I feel so happy, you personally <br>called &amp; wished to talk to me.<br><br>I feel scared thinking, <br>how can I change like this?<br><br>I can't say, I enjoyed my <br>childhood as other childrens.<br><br>I also had a house.<br>There was a father...<br><br>...and mother. But, our <br>house was a crushed one.<br><br>Yes. A broken home.<br><br>I also had some happy<br>moments in my childhood.<br><br>I still remember the things<br>happened in my childhood.<br><br>It was mixed with dream and reality.<br><br>Thoughts which come across<br>as dream. It's very sweet.<br><br>But, the reality is bitter.<br><br>Does every reality seems to be bitter, Arun?<br><br>I also had some laugh and dance in my teenage.<br><br>I liked to play hide and seek in those days.<br><br>We can't see with open <br>eyes during the game.<br><br>Have you played this game, Arun?<br><br>All my dreams of those days <br>disappear when I begin to see.<br><br>When my bangles broke at an unexpected<br>time like that, my life too broken away.<br><br>Manju.<br><br>Why didn't you came to house?<br><br>Yesterday, a man came with your mother...<br><br>...very tall and fat. Was it your father?<br><br>When I saw my mom in that situation, <br>the world around me broken into pieces.<br><br>Mom, the great lady in my mind fall<br>away from the highest place and died.<br><br>Even my friends knew about my mother.<br>What answer I could've given to their questions?<br><br>I sat alone and cried without<br>going to house at evening.<br><br>That was the last time <br>I cried in my life.<br><br>After that, whatever<br>bad thing happens...<br><br>...I hide my feelings without <br>showing it to others.<br><br>From there on, she used to carry <br>me along her, everywhere she goes.<br><br>I was there like a dumb witness.<br><br>My mother thought about her <br>happiness, not about my pain.<br><br>Father is not here, uncle.<br><br>I know.<br><br>Mother is also not here, uncle.<br><br>I know that too.<br><br>Are you studying?<br>Study... study...<br><br>Uncle, leave me...<br>Uncle, leave me...<br><br>Similar to a sudden attack to a person...<br><br>...who is standing without any weapons...<br><br>At an age of mischiefs, many experience<br>attacked me beyond my understanding.<br><br>I felt like an orphan.<br><br>I thought to say everything to my dad.<br><br>Should I say now? Should I say now? <br>One day, dad discovered everything.<br><br>What does a father can do to comprehend?<br><br>Despite recognising my mother as a <br>drainage, he continued living in that.<br><br>Sad.<br><br>Manju, have you eaten?<br><br>Hey, stop there. Why are you so late?<br><br>Can't you see?<br><br>Oh, are you telling me, you went to temple? <br>Or precisely to meet somebody in temple?<br><br>Why are you talking like this? <br>If anybody hears, they will laugh...<br><br>Whole town is already laughing.<br><br>You are trusting those waste <br>neighbours of ours, isn't it?<br><br>They are circulating lies, dear.<br>I am saying the truth. Trust me.<br><br>I promise on my Sutra. Trust me.<br><br>Don't lie.<br><br>Why are you beating me?<br><br>Don't beat me. What are you doing?<br><br>You made me ashamed.<br><br>- You are worst.<br>- Don't beat you?<br><br>Hey, donkey...<br><br>...how can you do this when<br>we have a teenage girl at home.<br><br>I will kill you.<br><br>Wife, Husband, Family. I lost all my <br>respect and trust on those words.<br><br>It seems to me like a slogan <br>of political procession...<br><br>...which eventually gets meaningless.<br><br>As I didn't like it at home, often <br>I used to run away from there.<br><br>There is a proverb, if the ghosts<br>rule, dead bodies will eat sastras.<br><br>...our home was also like that.<br><br>Eventhough, I was living with <br>my parents, I grown up alone.<br><br>I have the same feeling now.<br><br>Sometime in everyone's presence, I felt alone.<br><br>A feeling of having no <br>connection with anything.<br><br>Because, I had no friends to share anything.<br><br>Why are you not saying anything?<br><br>I really didn't felt anything<br>while listening to you.<br><br>Having lot of experiences in one's life <br>that even in childhood is a great thing.<br><br>If I feel sad on one side,<br>I feel jealous on another.<br><br>My head is already very cold. You don't <br>have to keep ice there with your words.<br><br>Come. Let's have a hot cup of coffee.<br><br>- No.<br>- For me.<br><br>Why are you not coming to temple?<br><br>My skills are not working with this God...<br><br>...even if I speak in insulting manner, no reply.<br><br>If there is no reaction, what's<br>the use of talking to a stone?<br><br>Nowdays, you seem to be very busy...<br><br>What busy?<br><br>House, then office or to <br>roam with Arun somewhere.<br><br>So, you liked this film job?<br><br>No.<br><br>Do you like Arun?<br><br>I like the way you talk.<br><br>Hey, Manju. Didn't you thought<br>that he is a different character?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>But, the burdens I am taking are bought by him.<br><br>So, you guys are going <br>for shopping regularly?<br><br>How foolish!<br><br>I didn't mean that. I'm able<br>to speak with him openly.<br><br>I scolded him on that day<br>in one mood and felt sad.<br><br>I felt why did I do that?<br><br>I called him directly to say,<br>why I behaved in that manner.<br><br>And, I told everything about my parents.<br><br>So, you have become close with him.<br><br>What do you mean?<br><br>If you are not close with him, why<br>would you say about family matter?<br><br>No no, not like that.<br><br>I felt to say, so I said.<br><br>Anyway, Manju. If you have a<br>friend like him, I am also happy.<br><br>Is the location okay for you?<br><br>But, if they don't allow for shooting?<br><br>Why are you worrying about that?<br><br>You will get it.<br><br>I came here already before.<br><br>When?<br><br>With Manju.<br><br>Wrong, dear. Why so eccentric?<br>Is she co-operating with you nicely?<br><br>It is very astonishing.<br><br>Why?<br><br>She won't socialise with anybody steadily.<br><br>Very unpredictable woman.<br><br>She is in touch with you<br>continuously, so I asked.<br><br>What is there in it?<br><br>If anybody else was there, no problem.<br>But, she! She is very hard nut to crack.<br><br>- Why do you hate women so much? <br>- What? Hatred?<br><br>If my hatred comes over women, I'll commit <br>suicide. What is life without them? Go, man.<br><br>You are saying about making <br>documentary on women and all.<br><br>I have written a poetry on women.<br><br>""Enjoy the woman.<br>Don't experiment.""<br><br>""Let she follow you.<br>Don't follow her.""'<br><br>""Search the girl.<br>Don't search her heart.""<br><br>""Dont get fooled by a woman.<br>Dont get fooled for a woman.""<br><br>""Hey, friend, Iron is not <br>the only metal that bends...""<br><br>""...women too bends.""<br><br>Enough, enough. I have no time <br>to listen your poetry. Good night.<br><br>Whom do you want?<br><br>I want to meet Manju.<br>l am Manju's friend.<br><br>Everyone comes here &amp; say the same.<br><br>My name is Arun.<br><br>Oh, you are that Arun?<br><br>About me, Manju...<br><br>I know, I know.

Any important news?<br><br>No. We have to meet one person for my film.<br><br>Who's that?<br><br>Playback Singer, Janaki.<br><br>Janaki who sang, ""Machana Pathingala?""<br><br>I only know ""Singaravelane"" Janaki.<br><br>You are taking her with <br>you to Janaki's house?<br><br>While going for an interview, <br>if a girl is with us, it looks good.<br><br>Girl? Manju? Hmm!<br><br>How would you see good time <br>having company of bad luck?<br><br>Your fate.<br><br>l have some work inside. Inform me once <br>when you leave. I have to lock the door.<br><br>What happened, Manju? <br>Why are you so dull?<br><br>We can't find reason for everything.<br><br>It's not necessary as well.<br><br>You always seem to be happy. <br>But, today you are very silent.<br><br>- That's why, I asked.<br>- Nothing.<br><br>While we are walking together,<br>it seems you are walking alone.<br><br>What are you thinking about?<br><br>Your sister talked about <br>you in a different way.<br><br>What does she said? Tell me.<br><br>She said to me, ""Leave my sister <br>and go alone to Janaki's house.""<br><br>Oh, nice. Only that much<br>she said. Innocent aunt.<br><br>What?<br><br>Are you shocked?<br><br>The person whom she called <br>as sister, now calling her as aunt.<br><br>Yes, she is my aunt.<br><br>Father's sister. She took pity on me...<br><br>...and kept me in her house.<br><br>But, why she treat you like this?<br><br>She feels pride on the fact<br>that she kept me in her house.<br><br>Okay, leave it.<br><br>But, she is treating you like this...<br><br>Arun.<br><br>I am not responsible for my situation.<br><br>l am forced to the situation.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Don't ask about this anymore.<br><br>See...<br><br>- I... <br>- Keep quiet.<br><br>- l am sorry. <br>- Please, don't spoil this evening.<br><br>Taxi.<br><br>There is no waterflow in the <br>river for the lifeboat to cross<br><br>There is no waterflow in the <br>river for the lifeboat to cross<br><br>There is no chariot in the town<br>for anyone to go in the chariot<br><br>Somewhere, something, someone<br><br>There is no waterflow in the <br>river for the lifeboat to cross<br><br>There are fences between the<br>beautiful stage and wonderful music<br><br>An unhealed wound and hundreds of<br>thorns are there in the swinging legs<br><br>Feminity doesn't see happiness<br>in anything<br><br>Feminity doesn't see happiness<br>in anything<br><br>Is the girl a unburnt light?<br><br>There is no waterflow in the <br>river for the life boat to cross<br><br>There are stages everywhere<br>in the town with disguise kings.<br><br>They are not real kings<br><br>There are gardens everywhere<br>in the town with scented rose<br><br>They are not roses truly..<br><br>Feminity is not elevated in the world.<br><br>Feminity is not elevated in the <br>world.

You said you have <br>some questions to ask.<br><br>Why are you trimming your eyebrow?<br>I mean, why are you doing it artificially?<br><br>If everything goes natural, <br>who would enjoy then?<br><br>In cinema, for audience enjoyment...<br><br>...especially, for men's enjoyment...<br><br>...you are putting makeup. <br>Don't you feel like a slave?<br><br>Sir, I think you have lot's of free time.<br><br>So, by having these weird thoughts<br>you are confusing your mind.<br><br>See. In the morning, I had Heroine<br>character who fought for her virginity.<br><br>In daytime, I was prostitute...<br><br>...and a princess in the night.<br><br>There is no time to think about these, sir.<br><br>Check, check.<br><br>Check, check.<br><br>What's your opinion on<br>the world of cinema?<br><br>Everybody willingly watches cinema.<br><br>But,<br><br>There are people who have<br>wrong idea on film actresses.<br><br>When a girl stands before a camera...<br><br>...they think, she must've lost her virginity.<br><br>I feel very hasty.<br><br>Why sir?<br><br>The women outside the cinema world...<br><br>...can pour rain with their innocence?<br><br>Please forgive me for saying like this.<br><br>No, carry on.<br><br>It's surprising to know about<br>the tragedy of this world.<br><br>It is the world of cinema...<br><br>...and people write stories around it.<br><br>Oh, I forgot. Sundaramurthy <br>brother, 'Kumaran arts' has...<br><br>...asked call sheets for tomorrow <br>morning. Tell them it's impossible. <br><br>What are you blabbering?<br><br>Spit out and tell them my words.<br><br>What were you saying?<br><br>Oh, sorry.

While shooting, you begin <br>to laugh infront of them in the set itself?<br><br>Sorry, Arun.<br><br>They talked about their love, isn't it?<br><br>Love, our love is so scared and holy...<br><br>...I felt like vomiting.<br><br>l was unble to bear that.<br><br>They said what they know.<br><br>Mr. Arun<br><br>Love, affection, care... these words <br>have no meaning at all. All are lies.<br><br>You may not believe these...<br><br>...but, for that, doing this, in insulting manner...<br><br>No, Arun.

Love was destined, isn't it?<br><br>So, it happened.<br><br>When it was a massive <br>task to even talk to a boy...<br><br>...I can go anywhere with him according to <br>my wish seemed great fortune to me.<br><br>I was happy thinking, what I have is <br>something many can't afford to have.<br><br>If I think of it now, it seems funny.<br><br>We also rambled around<br>beaches, theatres, hotels...<br><br>...like lovebirds of press &amp; cinema.<br><br>I begin to think, my misery faded <br>away. And the happiness which...<br><br>...I have is stable and true.<br><br>Our love is holy and sacred are words <br>we repeated regularly then, you know...<br><br>...like we heard in that cinema shooting.<br><br>'l am not without him.

That is all.<br><br>These are the medicines he takes.<br><br>Who is this?<br><br>He is from, Kerala.<br><br>He is the one and only guardian to take care of this boy.<br><br>Oh, I see.<br><br>Any chance to give this boy back to us?<br><br>No, I don't think so.<br><br>No chance exists.<br><br>Because, in very similar way a child came here.<br><br>After many months, his father came took him away.<br><br>His father was in coma for many months<br><br>in some hospital.<br><br>The doctor says there is no chance of taking him back.<br><br>Last week, a similar boy was taken away by his father.<br><br>For about three months it seems he was in some hospital and in coma.<br><br>Praise the Lord<br><br>and surrender to him.<br><br>Mother father, younger sister will come.<br><br>Operator, tell sister that Kochundappri will come.<br><br>The time of meeting is over.<br><br>If no one comes to ask for him<br><br>then not as an orphan<br><br>but I will bring him up as my son.<br><br>What?

Arc (2021) - full transcript,"In the near future, Rina lives as a wanderer, after leaving her child and home town at the age of seventeen. She then meets Ema, head of the BodyWerks division at Eternity, a major cosmetics corporation. BodyWerks are actual body sculptures of the deceased, preserved as if they were living, a technology that is available to the public to overcome their loss of their loved ones. Meanwhile, Ema's rebellious brother and brilliant scientist Amane begins research using this technology to stop aging among the living, granting them immortality. Through Ema and Amane, Rina gains new insights and embarks on a journey to become the first immortal in human history.","<div class=""full-script"">17 years old<br><br>19 years old<br><br>Good evening.

because<br><br>that's what we all<br>secretly wish for, no?<br><br>What would you do?<br><br>That's the point.<br>You make the choice.<br><br>Long time no see.<br><br>You do look like you've been<br>on a space shuttle and back.<br><br>How many bodies<br>do you work on per day?<br><br>About 20.<br><br>Quite a lot.<br><br>We have more people working here now.<br>I only handle a

<br><br>and on those who have made it<br><br>will also make as much of an impact<br>on you<br><br>and that you will also like it.<br><br>Namaskar.<br><br>Do you always carry<br>these photographs with you?<br><br>Yes. Always in my bag.<br><br>I never part with them.<br>I keep them with me.<br><br>Just imagine somebody running<br>with a gun behind my father,<br><br>just so that he's dead!<br><br>I exactly want to know minute to<br>minute what happened that day.<br><br>Did my father,<br>on the spot, just fall down?<br><br>What did he do? How did it happen?<br>Where were the dead bodies lying?<br><br>What was his expression?<br>Were his clothes torn?<br><br>How much blood went?<br><br>And if anybody has clicked,<br><br>his dead body's picture<br>with the blood...<br><br>because the photograph I have,<br><br>is after he was cleaned.<br><br>He was wrapped up in a sheet.<br><br>That is what I want to see,<br>exactly last minute what happened.<br><br>May I ask why do you want<br>to know these details?<br><br>Because I want to feel the suffering<br>my father went through.<br><br>On 31st July 1985,<br><br>Lalit Maken and his wife<br>Geetanjali were killed,<br><br>at their home in Kirti Nagar,<br>New Delhi.<br><br>Maken was a Congress<br>Member of Parliament,<br><br>and his wife was<br>a Congress Party worker.<br><br>Date was 31st July.<br><br>I don't know the exact time,<br>because I was in school.<br><br>I was in Grade One.<br><br>And that day,<br><br>my cousins Dheeraj and Nidhi,<br><br>both were together,<br>and they were coming down the stairs.<br><br>And that day they wanted to<br>go and see the Parliament.<br><br>As we were leaving,<br>uncle and aunt were a little ahead.<br><br>There were two people standing<br>near a scooter, on our left.<br><br>They suddenly took out guns<br><br>from a bag<br><br>and they started shooting.<br><br>Uncle immediately shouted,<br>""Run inside!""<br><br>So I ran up the stairs.<br><br>I wasn't the main target.<br><br>And right there... downstairs...<br>they started...<br><br>My father passed away<br>right on the spot.<br><br>My mother was still alive.<br><br>And hats off<br>to my paternal grandmother.<br><br>She saw her son lying dead.<br><br>Immediately,<br>she picked up her daughter-in-law.<br><br>But then, my mother lost her life,<br><br>in the hospital, I believe,<br><br>in the surgery...<br>or whatever happened...<br><br>And I remember going and kissing her.<br><br>Kissing my mother...<br><br>And then something like a tear<br>came out of her eyes.<br><br>I don't know medically what it was.<br><br>And my uncle wiped the tears.<br><br>My maternal grandmother<br>was a legislator at that time<br><br>from Madhya Pradesh.<br><br>She came and told me,<br><br>""We are taking you along,<br>but you are not to cry.""<br><br>And because I promised her,<br>I didn't cry till they were...<br><br>cremated also.<br><br>My father used to have<br>an Ambassador car.<br><br>One day, I was sitting in our<br>Kirti Nagar house, and a car arrived.<br><br>And I got up thinking Papa has come,<br>and then I realized,<br><br>""Papa hasn't come... he cannot come.""<br><br>I live in Ludhiana.<br><br>Almost all my childhood<br>I have lived here,<br><br>I have studied in Ludhiana.<br><br>I did my Masters<br>in Genetics and Crop Sciences.<br><br>I was a gold medalist in MSc.<br><br>Then, after that, I was accepted<br>for my fellowship for PhD,<br><br>in Kansas State in 1985...<br><br>when I was completing my MSc.<br><br>But, beforehand, because<br>of the events of 1984,<br><br>I had to take a decision.<br><br>Either, I go for PhD,<br><br>or should I go for the Sikhs.<br><br>In 1984, there was rising<br>disenchantment within Punjab.<br><br>And there was a call given by<br>the Dharam Yudh Morcha,<br><br>under the command<br>of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale,<br><br>that from June 3rd,<br>they're going to start<br><br>the civil disobedience movement.<br><br>Meaning, we're not going<br>to give you any tax.<br><br>We're not going to sell you<br>our produce and things like that.<br><br>Then, the Government of India, under<br>the command of Mrs. Indira Gandhi,<br><br>who was at that time<br>the Prime Minister of India,<br><br>ordered the Army attack,<br><br>on the Golden Temple.<br><br>That was in the first week of June.<br><br>And a full-fledged army, like<br>they were fighting an enemy battle.<br><br>[Intense gunfire exchange between<br>Army and militants at Golden Temple]<br><br>There was total military rule<br>in Punjab.<br><br>Civil administration came<br>under military rule.<br><br>And tanks were put up<br>in universities and colleges.<br><br>Even in women's colleges.<br><br>That, I have seen myself.<br><br>Then, I started talking<br>to my close friends.<br><br>""What to do?""<br><br>Our main issue was,<br><br>that Sikhs have lost their dignity.<br><br>Their pride has been crushed.<br><br>Their identity is under crisis.<br><br>These three things<br>were paramount on my mind.<br><br>In between,<br><br>Indira Gandhi got killed.<br><br>[Mrs. Gandhi is assassinated.<br>Her son takes over.]<br><br>[Indira Gandhi, the ruler<br>of the world's largest democracy]<br><br>[died today.]<br><br>[Shot down by<br>two of her own bodyguards.]<br><br>[They were Sikhs taking revenge]<br><br>[for the invasion<br>of their temple in June.]<br><br>And it was a sign of jubilation<br>for Sikhs.<br><br>People did stop buses,<br><br>and forced people to eat sweets...<br><br>Hindu people.<br><br>[But already tonight<br>the tensions between]<br><br>[the majority Hindus<br>and the Sikh community, ]<br><br>[are spilling over into violence.]<br><br>What we heard<br>on the next day was that,<br><br>Sikhs have been made targets.<br><br>And they are being attacked<br>by the mobs... angry mobs,<br><br>which were supposedly Hindu, mostly.<br><br>And they were looting<br>their places of business.<br><br>They were destroying their houses.<br><br>They were literally<br>burning Sikhs alive.<br><br>That thing shook us.<br><br>I went to railway stations to...<br><br>to receive people who were coming<br>from Delhi, from Kanpur<br><br>from other places,<br><br>as sympathy.<br><br>What could we do?<br>We could just guide them,<br><br>help them look<br>for accommodation somewhere...<br><br>whatever it was.<br><br>I went to Delhi after 13 days.<br><br>I've seen the refugee camps.<br><br>At that time around 50,000 Sikhs<br>were living in refugee camps.<br><br>Then, we read that book.<br><br>The book came after<br>a month and a half or so,<br><br>'Who Are The Guilty?'<br><br>It was a fact-finding report.<br><br>It came out in the end of November.<br><br>And I read it in December of 1984.<br><br>In that book,<br><br>there was a detailed description<br>of the events,<br><br>after the assassination<br>of Mrs. Indira Gandhi.<br><br>And then they named<br>the main perpetrators of that carnage<br><br>who were the sitting MPs in Delhi<br>representing the Congress Party.<br><br>That made me resolve that<br><br>no matter what it takes<br><br>we will go after the people<br>who are behind the riots.<br><br>Within, I think, 20th of July,<br><br>we were in Delhi.<br><br>In one day we could've killed<br>three of them.<br><br>Information was given to us by Sikh<br>sympathizers inside the Congress.<br><br>Then we thought, which could be<br>the easiest target...<br><br>rather than going for all the kills.<br><br>For that, Lalit Maken, when<br>we tracked his house,<br><br>where he used to hold<br>his meetings in Kirti Nagar...<br><br>that was the safest.<br><br>[Member of Parliament, Lalit Maken<br>and wife killed]<br><br>When we killed Maken...<br><br>we hit him when he came out.<br><br>He was hit eight or nine times,<br><br>on the first attempt.<br><br>But still, he got up.<br><br>He rose up and went<br>back to his house.<br><br>Walked, diligently.<br><br>We thought<br>that we weren't successful.<br><br>So, we had to take<br>a bigger weapon, sten gun.<br><br>At that time his wife,<br><br>she leapt on him.<br><br>She came out of the house?<br><br>Yes, she came...<br>He went inside the verandah.<br><br>Inside the house.<br><br>Verandah of his house? House...<br><br>And she leapt on him.<br><br>Meaning she hugged him?<br>She just lay on him.<br><br>She lay on him?<br><br>Our people tried to take her aside.<br><br>But, they were unsuccessful.<br>And we were short of time.<br><br>Then, there was no option<br>other than to hit them.<br><br>Then he was hit with 28 bullets.<br><br>With a sten gun?<br><br>Sten gun.<br><br>And she?<br><br>She was hit, too.<br><br>There was an eye for an eye.<br><br>We needed it.<br><br>That's what you felt?<br>Yeah, we felt it.<br><br>Till date...<br><br>my father is...<br><br>the main...<br><br>He has left a very big vacuum<br>in my life.<br><br>I don't think I can love<br>any man the way I've...<br><br>neither my sons nor anybody.<br><br>I am totally my father's daughter.<br><br>I was extremely possessive about him.<br><br>I couldn't even share him<br>with my mother.<br><br>I used to keep telling him,<br><br>""When I grow up,<br>I am going to marry you.""<br><br>How old were you when<br>your parents passed away?<br><br>You can say, six.<br>My birthday was on 10th August.<br><br>And at that time if anyone asked me,<br><br>""What do you want to be<br>when you grow up?""<br><br>I would say, ""I want to kill<br>the people who killed my parents.""<br><br>That anger was definitely there that,<br><br>I have to kill these people, anyhow!<br><br>Come what may, I have to<br>avenge my parents.<br><br>If I met the killer at that time,<br>even as a child,<br><br>even if I couldn't do anything<br><br>I would've wanted<br>to kill that person.<br><br>Suddenly, it happened.<br><br>He didn't come home.<br><br>We were worried.<br><br>The police came asking,<br><br>""Where did your son go?""<br><br>""How did he become a revolutionary?""<br><br>I said,<br>""I don't know anything about this.""<br><br>After that,<br><br>15 days went by, then a month.<br><br>But we couldn't find him.<br><br>The police launched<br>a nationwide manhunt<br><br>but Kuki evaded arrest.<br><br>Soon, he escaped<br>to the United States,<br><br>with his friend, Sukhi...<br>Sukhminder Singh Sandhu.<br><br>I went to the US<br>on 28th February, 1986.<br><br>We wanted to know<br>what kind of support we have.<br><br>If we're going to fight against the<br>Indian nation for a separate state,<br><br>we need some support...<br><br>from somewhere.<br><br>Then, we started contacting<br>the Sikhs,<br><br>who were the main, prominent,<br><br>protagonists of the Sikh movement.<br><br>You can call it the Khalistan<br>movement or whatever you want.<br><br>So, we told them exactly how it is<br>in Punjab and what we can do,<br><br>and we have to seek the support<br>of the Pakistan government.<br><br>Officially.<br><br>But Pakistan was not agreeable.<br><br>They were asking for money<br>and other things like that.<br><br>So, ultimately,<br><br>we told our friends who were<br>running the movement,<br><br>that we had no support.<br><br>So, we decided we should go back.<br><br>Go back to India.<br><br>Let's see.<br><br>Whether we live or die,<br>we will fight for it.<br><br>And we got arrested in<br>the middle of that day.<br><br>And that was 14th May, 1987.<br><br>Kuki and Sukhi were arrested<br><br>by the American authorities<br>in New Jersey,<br><br>just as they were preparing<br>to fly out of the US.<br><br>Firstly, the Interpol warrant<br>was against us,<br><br>for suspicion of being involved<br>in the conspiracy,<br><br>to kill General Vaidya, who was<br>the Chief of the Indian Army,<br><br>during the Indian Army attack<br>on the Golden Temple.<br><br>Secondly, I was...<br><br>named in the killing of Lalit Maken.<br><br>And Sukhi was charged with<br><br>the conspiracy<br>to kill General Vaidya.<br><br>There's a saying<br>in our holy scripture, the Gurbani,<br><br>""Whatever happens is His will.""<br><br>""Whatever happens is His will.""<br><br>But my wife, Surjeet Kaur...<br><br>she was heartbroken.<br><br>He was our youngest child.<br><br>She loved him a lot.<br><br>When my parents passed away,<br><br>my mother's sister, who lives<br>in Chandigarh, wanted to keep me,<br><br>and my father's sister<br>wanted to keep me, too.<br><br>The Sharmas didn't let me<br>stay with my father's sister.<br><br>And the Makens didn't let me<br>stay with my mother's sister.<br><br>They went to court over my custody,<br><br>and ultimately no one took me.<br><br>I know Avantika since 1987<br><br>when she was enrolled<br>at boarding school,<br><br>Maharani Gayatri Devi Girls' School.<br><br>It was the first time Avantika<br>came to a boarding school.<br><br>She was very bubbly<br>and energetic.<br><br>We got along very well.<br><br>There was a lot of anger in her.<br><br>That's something we used to see<br>because she used to get angry.<br><br>But definitely we didn't know<br>that she had lost her parents.<br><br>At least I didn't know, as she<br>came in earlier, but Shweta knew.<br><br>I got to know a little later,<br><br>and that's when you realize...<br><br>Now we realize that<br>not having parents is...<br><br>it's almost like<br>the end of the world.<br><br>Avantika had brought her mother's<br>vanity case to school<br><br>she was in grade three.<br><br>It had lipsticks, nail paints,<br>as it is.<br><br>Yes. Avantika's mother's.<br>I'm getting goose bumps.<br><br>Avantika shared with me that<br>the day her parents died,<br><br>she was sent to school<br>in the morning.<br><br>And her mother was angry<br>with Avantika for some reason.<br><br>Her mother scolded, ""I won't come<br>to pick you from school today.""<br><br>And... then the event happened.<br><br>So somewhere it was there<br>in her mind...<br><br>""Maybe, if mother hadn't said that,<br>she might still be here.""<br><br>On 25th July, 1992,<br><br>Avantika's maternal grandfather,<br>Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma,<br><br>was sworn in as<br>the ninth President of India.<br><br>Avantika, then 12 years old,<br><br>returned to Delhi to live<br>with her maternal grandparents,<br><br>after having spent four years<br>at boarding school.<br><br>Rashtrapati Bhavan is like<br>paradise on earth.<br><br>The biggest presidential palace<br>in the world.<br><br>I had my own room there.<br><br>I learnt how to swim there.<br><br>I learnt how to play the piano there.<br><br>I learnt a lot.<br><br>I travelled a lot.<br><br>Because they took me for every trip.<br><br>My grandmother was happy that<br>I had returned from boarding school.<br><br>But the people around my grandmother<br>didn't want me there.<br><br>And those relatives didn't want me<br>to even play with their children.<br><br>They used to say,<br>""Avantika is very rash.""<br><br>""Avantika is crazy.""<br><br>Even as a teenager,<br>I was a topic of discussion.<br><br>I still remember,<br>once I was half asleep,<br><br>and some elders of the family<br>were criticizing me,<br><br>and I could hear them.<br><br>And I was pretending to be asleep,<br><br>because I didn't have the courage<br>to confront them,<br><br>and say, ""I can hear you.""<br><br>I still remember,<br>there's a retreat near Shimla,<br><br>which is supposed to be the summer<br>house for the President of India.<br><br>I still remember, we went there,<br><br>and while walking in the garden,<br>I said,<br><br>""I am missing home a lot.""<br><br>One of my relatives retorted,<br>""What home do you have?""<br><br>See, however harsh it might sound,<br><br>the fact is I'm an orphan.<br><br>I've been fond of training<br>since I was in jail.<br><br>Prison walls are such,<br><br>that once you enter,<br>your brain gets shut down.<br><br>One layer after another collapses.<br><br>To protect yourself<br>from that collapse,<br><br>you have to fill it up<br>with something.<br><br>We were locked up<br>in a prison within a prison,<br><br>on the 9th floor.<br><br>It was called<br>Metropolitan Correctional Center.<br><br>It was famously called,<br><br>the prison...<br><br>where people become dumb,<br><br>or they become numb.<br><br>American jail life starts<br>at 6 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>First thing, you have to...<br><br>you have to go<br>to take your breakfast.<br><br>They give you cereals, porridge,<br><br>and two cartons of milk,<br>and fruit.<br><br>After that, either you go back<br>to your cell<br><br>or you are assigned a job...<br>voluntarily.<br><br>I took the job for mopping<br>and cleaning up of the main floor.<br><br>We had a small yard,<br><br>where we could do<br>some push ups, pull ups.<br><br>Health-wise, you could exercise.<br><br>Otherwise to fill up your mind,<br>you had to read.<br><br>On the surface<br>it looks very reasonable...<br><br>if we compare it to Indian standards.<br><br>But, the sense of fear...<br><br>the fear of...<br><br>being enclosed within 8 to 10 yards.<br><br>We were kept in a facility which is<br>only built for 90 days.<br><br>In 90 days,<br>either your trial is finished...<br><br>either you go out,<br><br>or you go to the bigger prisons.<br><br>Whatever your sentence is.<br><br>And you can well imagine,<br>in that 90-day facility,<br><br>I spent 10 years.<br><br>I never saw greenery for 10 years.<br><br>Birds...<br><br>We could see the rain,<br><br>but, we couldn't feel it.<br><br>Time stops.<br><br>If you are sitting in the same room,<br>day after day,<br><br>time stops.<br><br>How to survive another day?<br><br>It's a day-to-day existence.<br><br>And we had no hope<br>that we would ever come out.<br><br>But, in our minds, we had<br>to keep ourselves alive...<br><br>that we will make it,<br><br>no matter what happens.<br><br>What did you miss the most?<br><br>Inside prison?<br><br>Freedom.<br><br>Nothing compares with freedom.<br><br>At that time I thought...<br><br>even if they give me<br>one hour to sit outside,<br><br>of the prison,<br><br>that will be the biggest moment<br>of my life.<br><br>My grandparents,<br>paternal or maternal,<br><br>deserve a 100 out of 100,<br>with whatever they have done for me.<br><br>But once you start growing up,<br><br>that's the time you realize<br>that you really need parents.<br><br>Grandparents can do<br>whatever best they can do<br><br>but nobody can compensate<br>for parents.<br><br>So I think a lot of things<br>which happened in my life,<br><br>whether it was my first marriage<br>or whatever...<br><br>Because getting married<br>at the age of 18,<br><br>and having a baby at the age of 19...<br><br>That was, I think, just wanting<br>to have someone of my own.<br><br>I wanted a home of my own,<br>my own family,<br><br>people who would be entirely my own.<br><br>When Anirudh was born,<br>I was so happy.<br><br>After I had conceived him, I remember<br>giving the high school exams.<br><br>Anirudh was like...<br><br>my child, my blood.<br><br>This was when Anirudh<br>was 40 days old.<br><br>After Anirudh was born,<br>and when I was around 22-23,<br><br>my ex-husband kind of deserted me.<br><br>So I was on my own and<br>it was very difficult,<br><br>whether it was financially...<br><br>because, I didn't have any support<br>system, be it parents or siblings.<br><br>I never wanted Anirudh<br>to feel left out in any way.<br><br>Although I feel extremely sorry...<br>for Anirudh...<br><br>because he has had a very tough life.<br><br>So, Anirudh... I just...<br><br>Anirudh went through a lot.<br><br>I feel very sorry because,<br><br>I was very young,<br><br>and I couldn't support him<br>the way I should have.<br><br>We always used to be together.<br><br>We studied in the same school,<br>slept in the same room,<br><br>till I got married.<br><br>He was a lovable,<br>affectionate brother.<br><br>Sometimes naughty.<br><br>Every alternate day, he wrote me<br>a letter, from jail.<br><br>With your brother being in jail,<br>what did you go through?<br><br>You know, being a sister,<br>a lot of things.<br><br>I felt very hurt.<br><br>Maybe... I was hurt... not knowing<br>whether I would see him alive again.<br><br>Kuki and Sukhi remained in prison<br>for well over a decade.<br><br>First in New York<br>and then at Otisville.<br><br>The Indian government waged a long<br>legal battle for their extradition.<br><br>Sikhs in the United States hired<br>prominent human rights lawyers,<br><br>to defend Kuki and Sukhi.<br><br>Eventually,<br>14 years after his arrest,<br><br>Kuki won a judicial victory<br>in his extradition case.<br><br>I got denial of extradition.<br><br>The US government acted in my favour.<br><br>Sukhi's extradition was granted.<br><br>But he could've appealed<br>to a higher court.<br><br>But, by that time,<br>we had made up our minds.<br><br>Whether we win or we lose,<br><br>we're going back.<br><br>It was 14 years.<br><br>We said that we'll face<br>whatever happens.<br><br>We remember the day<br>he was extradited.<br><br>The police were everywhere.<br><br>He was taken away in a car.<br>They told us, ""Kuki is in that car.""<br><br>We went to meet him the next day.<br><br>- Where?<br>- Tihar jail.<br><br>He said, ""No, Devinder.<br>You should not come here.""<br><br>I said, ""No, I will come.""<br><br>That was my first experience<br>of Indian prisons.<br><br>There's just a bare cell.<br><br>On a cemented,<br>lifted bed type of thing,<br><br>there are two blankets,<br><br>which you can smell<br>from 15 yards away.<br><br>As you know, in India,<br><br>the case lingered on.<br><br>And the verdict came in 2003.<br><br>The judge said, ""Devinder...""<br>He took father's name too...<br><br>""Dr. Gill, Ranjit is convicted.""<br><br>So Kukiji, the Sessions Court<br>refused to consider<br><br>the 14 years you've spent<br>in prison in the US.<br><br>You were convicted for life.<br><br>You tell me, Svati, what to do?<br><br>But, he wrote in his judgment,<br><br>""No doubt he's a convict,<br><br>but he's not a criminal.""<br><br>""And I urge the government of Delhi,<br><br>to sympathetically look at his case,<br>for early release.""<br><br>At that time Sheila Dikshit was<br>the Chief Minister of Delhi.<br><br>Judge told me, ""Devinder,<br>go to Sheila Dikshit""<br><br>and ask for his remission.""<br><br>But, they deferred my case.<br><br>Who deferred your case?<br>Sheila Dikshit.<br><br>They had a parole board hearing.<br><br>But Avantika Maken did not agree...<br><br>to my release.<br><br>I lost my childhood<br>at the age of six.<br><br>I have lost everything,<br>they haven't lost anything.<br><br>How can they decide?<br><br>Then I called up<br>Sheila Dikshit's assistant.<br><br>I said,<br><br>""If you do anything to free him,<br><br>I will start a protest<br>outside the Chief Minister's house.""<br><br>I said, ""Nothing doing!<br>He has to go behind bars.""<br><br>Because I lost my childhood,<br>I lost my parents.<br><br>I have lived with that.<br>I wanted him to be behind bars.<br><br>I went to the extent of saying,<br>""Why put behind bars?

I keep thinking<br>of my daughter, Rani.<br><br>On the 25th of February, 1995,<br><br>Sister Rani Maria,<br>a 41-year old nun from Kerala,<br><br>was stabbed to death near the town of<br>Udainagar in Madhya Pradesh.<br><br>Rani Maria was killed<br>in broad daylight<br><br>while travelling on a bus,<br>carrying passengers to a nearby city.<br><br>That day, Rani Maria,<br><br>was to go to Kerala.<br><br>So I was waiting for her.<br><br>I was in Bhopal,<br><br>she was in Udainagar.<br><br>She had to travel in the morning<br>from Udainagar to Bhopal.<br><br>So, that night, by Kerala Express,<br>both of us had to leave for Kerala<br><br>for a meeting.<br><br>At 12.45, I got the message...<br><br>I got the phone call...<br>I, myself, answered the phone.<br><br>Then I was told,<br><br>""She was killed.<br>Rani Maria was killed!""<br><br>""And you have to come to Udainagar,<br><br>and collect the dead body.""<br><br>First stabbing was on the hand,<br><br>then she was holding the iron bar,<br><br>and he kept on stabbing.<br><br>Like that... 54 wounds, she got.<br><br>Then the driver said,<br>""Don't do it in the bus.""<br><br>So he pulled her down.<br><br>This is the spot<br>where she was pulled down.<br><br>When this attack took place,<br><br>I was at our Provincial House<br>in Bhopal.<br><br>I was ill.<br><br>What were you suffering from?<br>I was suffering from cancer.<br><br>I was devastated...<br><br>because it was I who had<br>been counting my days.<br><br>I asked God,<br><br>""Why did You snatch<br>my sister away so soon?""<br><br>""I have cancer,<br>I am in a serious condition.""<br><br>""Why didn't You take me instead?""<br><br>""My sister was doing<br>such good work.""<br><br>""Why did You take her, God?""<br>I kept asking God these questions.<br><br>""All she did was serve the poor.""<br><br>""She fulfilled Your will.""<br><br>""Then why did she meet<br>with such a fate?""<br><br>""Why did You let this happen, God?""<br><br>""My sister died all alone<br>in the forest.""<br><br>""No one was with her.""<br><br>""She died inch-by-inch.<br>Why did You let her die this way?""<br><br>I kept asking God these questions.<br><br>Today is 25th February.<br><br>It's on this day,<br>that Sister Rani Maria passed away.<br><br>Or you may say she was martyred.<br><br>And we've all gathered here<br>to remember her.<br><br>I was with her since the year 1990.<br><br>Together we had formed<br>a self-help group,<br><br>and we gave small farmers<br>manure, seeds...<br><br>It's impossible to enumerate,<br><br>all that Rani Maria did<br>for our village in five years.<br><br>The most important thing she did,<br>was to solve our severe water crisis.<br><br>This whole area was dry.<br><br>Women were forced to walk<br>three kilometers to fetch water.<br><br>This water supply system<br>that you see here<br><br>was built with Rani Maria's support.<br><br>This tube well here and pipeline<br>supply water to the entire village.<br><br>Even today, the whole village<br>gets water from here.<br><br>Each household has been<br>given a connection.<br><br>The idea was Rani Maria's,<br><br>the money came from the government,<br>and the labour was ours.<br><br>Her heart was always<br>with the underprivileged.<br><br>She didn't believe in charity<br>or giving handouts.<br><br>Her goal was to empower people,<br>and become self-reliant.<br><br>The poor people of this area,<br><br>used to go to the moneylenders,<br><br>to borrow money for cultivation.<br><br>The farmers would go<br>to the moneylenders for loans,<br><br>and the moneylenders charged them<br>double interest rates.<br><br>Then my sister told the farmers<br>about bank loans.<br><br>She helped them start<br>cottage industries.<br><br>In these ways people started<br>saving some money.<br><br>Obviously,<br>the moneylenders and landlords<br><br>didn't like this.<br><br>She was a hindrance<br>for the moneylenders,<br><br>as their income was decreasing.<br><br>That was one of the things.<br><br>Then, they thought that we are<br>converting the people here.<br><br>In my village, nobody knows<br>their exact birth date.<br><br>Just a handful may know<br>the year of their birth.<br><br>""The year unseasonal rain<br>ruined the crop...""<br><br>That's how dates are identified.<br><br>But I guess I was born in 1966.<br><br>I was born here in Semaliya Raimal.<br><br>I grew up here.<br><br>My entire life<br>has been spent here...<br><br>It happened on 25th February, 1995.<br><br>That day I was travelling<br>from Udainagar to Indore<br><br>with some landlords.<br><br>Sister also boarded the same bus.<br><br>- Sister Rani Maria?<br>- Yes.<br><br>Just a few days prior, a landlord<br>had been beaten up by some tribals.<br><br>The landlords blamed<br>Sister Rani Maria for the attack.<br><br>They told me,<br><br>""We were attacked by people<br>converted by the missionaries,""<br><br>and the missionaries<br>will eventually destroy<br><br>""our Hindu organizations<br>and community.""<br><br>At first, I was sitting<br>with the landlords,<br><br>on the long passenger seat<br>in the driver's cabin.<br><br>Then, when the landlords<br>started instigating me,<br><br>they said, ""Don't sit with us, other<br>passengers will get suspicious.""<br><br>So, I got up and stood near<br>the entrance.<br><br>Then they started signaling me<br>to attack.<br><br>Q: How many shots did you fire?<br><br>Kasab: I don't know.<br>We just kept firing.<br><br>Q: Whom were you told to kill?<br><br>Q: Whom were you told to kill?<br><br>Q: For how long did you<br>plan to operate today?<br><br>They ordered us, ""Until you're alive<br>keep firing, dogs!""<br><br>But I wasn't able to gather<br>the courage.<br><br>I found the courage...<br><br>I attacked Sister Rani Maria.<br><br>I attacked her with a knife.<br><br>I stabbed her once, twice...<br><br>then I lost control.<br>I couldn't stop stabbing her.<br><br>It was as if I was possessed.<br><br>Had anyone intervened<br>at that moment,<br><br>I would have stabbed them as well.<br><br>Until the victim dies,<br>you can't stop.<br><br>What did Sister Rani Maria do?<br><br>She kept praying.<br><br>She'd realized that the landlords<br>were behind the attack.<br><br>She kept calling out, ""Jesus, Jesus!""<br><br>She was calling out to Jesus?<br><br>She didn't ask anyone for help.<br><br>I was unstoppable,<br>I dragged her out of the bus.<br><br>After dragging her down,<br>I stabbed her a few more times.<br><br>She breathed her last.<br><br>In those days<br><br>people believed Christians would<br>forcibly convert all the Hindus<br><br>and enslave our country.<br><br>I believed that every Hindu<br>who gets converted,<br><br>becomes an enemy of the nation.<br><br>There was hardly any newspaper<br>or television in my village.<br><br>One could easily be misled.<br><br>And the landlords who were educated<br>in the cities, would fool us.<br><br>They manipulated us.<br><br>I trusted them blindly.<br><br>I always believed what they said.<br><br>The landlords would choose<br>a gullible villager,<br><br>who could easily be conned.<br><br>They'd treat you to a few good meals,<br>give you some importance.<br><br>They'd say a few flattering things.<br><br>Did they offer bribes?<br><br>No. It's not that they offer money.<br><br>They just show you rosy dreams.<br><br>They make you believe that<br>you are special and important.<br><br>It was all just an illusion.<br><br>And ultimately,<br>the illusion shattered.<br><br>Within three days,<br>the murderers were arrested.<br><br>Samundar was the first<br>to be caught.<br><br>The other two were caught<br>the next day.<br><br>A week after my sister's death,<br>a priest told me,<br><br>""Selmi, you shouldn't pursue<br>the case.<br><br>As Christians, we should forgive.""<br><br>""You should go to prison,<br>meet them and forgive them.""<br><br>This was just a week<br>after the murder.<br><br>I was still very angry,<br><br>and wanted to pursue the case.<br><br>I felt that I was not yet ready<br>to meet the killer.<br><br>Ready, as in...<br><br>I needed time to prepare<br>myself, mentally and spiritually.<br><br>Because going to meet him in prison<br><br>wasn't an easy thing to do.<br><br>I had to prepare myself spiritually.<br><br>So I stayed at Udainagar and prayed.<br><br>Everyday, I sat in church<br><br>and prayed for everyone.<br><br>What was the court's verdict?<br><br>Life imprisonment.<br><br>Life imprisonment?<br>Life imprisonment.<br><br>And what about the landlords<br>who were with you?<br><br>They were also sentenced for life.<br><br>Then we appealed to the High Court,<br><br>and the landlords got bail<br>right away.<br><br>From the High Court?<br>Yes, from the High Court.<br><br>And my bail was rejected.<br><br>For how long were<br>the landlords behind bars?<br><br>Four months in all.<br><br>In prison, I kept asking myself,<br><br>""Why did I make such a huge mistake?""<br><br>""Why did I kill her?""<br><br>I couldn't find an answer.<br><br>And no matter how deep my regret,<br><br>it wasn't going to bring Sister<br>back to life.<br><br>I had blinding headaches.<br><br>When I tried to read<br>the newspaper, I couldn't.<br><br>My vision would blur with tears.<br><br>One day, a High Court judge came<br>to visit the prison.<br><br>I pleaded with him,<br><br>""Sir, I am disturbed and depressed,<br><br>and my family members are starving.""<br><br>The judge said just one thing,<br><br>""Imagine the suffering you inflicted<br>on the person you killed.""<br><br>""Imagine the suffering<br>of her family members.""<br><br>""If you pick up a cane<br>and hit yourself with it,<br><br>won't you feel pain?""<br><br>""Now, imagine the pain<br>the person you killed went through.""<br><br>That day I realized,<br>my troubles were nothing,<br><br>compared to the excruciating pain,<br><br>I had put Sister Rani Maria through.<br><br>Look, it's hardly grown.<br><br>How will these onions grow<br>when there isn't enough water...<br><br>The water supply has reduced further<br>since the last 15 days,<br><br>and if even this dries up,<br>what will I do?<br><br>In the years after<br>her sister's murder,<br><br>Selmi won her battle against cancer,<br><br>and became a teacher<br>at the Rani Maria Memorial School.<br><br>And to build the fortitude<br>to forgive her sister's killers,<br><br>she continued to seek strength<br>in prayer.<br><br>""Lord, have mercy on them.""<br><br>God is merciful... but I should also<br>feel like being merciful.<br><br>That's what I prayed for.<br><br>Seven years went by.<br><br>Then, in the year 2002,<br><br>a Catholic priest<br>called Swami Sadanand,<br><br>reached out to Sister Selmi<br>and Samundar.<br><br>Swami Sadanand had been working<br>for several years with convicts,<br><br>in the prisons of Madhya Pradesh.<br><br>Swamiji, what do you tell prisoners<br>when you visit them in jails?<br><br>First I sing a few bhajans.<br><br>Then I ask them,<br><br>""Is it better to inhale or exhale?""<br><br>First they say, ""Inhaling is better.""<br><br>Then they say, ""Exhaling is better.""<br><br>Then they agree that both are equal.<br><br>Then I ask them,<br>""Is day better or night better?""<br><br>Some say day, some say night.<br><br>Then all agree both are equal.<br><br>""Is summer better or winter better?""<br><br>""Both are equal.""<br><br>In the same way,<br><br>in life, joy and sorrow are equal.<br><br>Until you accept them both as equal,<br><br>you cannot truly become<br>a human being.<br><br>So I say,<br>if inhaling and exhaling are equal,<br><br>if joy and sorrow are equal,<br><br>enemy and friend are also equal.<br><br>Both are just an experience.<br><br>Accept them both as an experience.<br><br>Only then can you rise above them.<br><br>One day, in prison,<br>the Jailor sent for me.<br><br>He said, ""Someone has come<br>to see you.""<br><br>I asked, ""Who is it?""<br><br>""Some monk,"" the Jailor replied.<br><br>I knew nothing about<br>Swami Sadanandji at that time.<br><br>I bowed and paid my respects<br>to the monk.<br><br>Then, I asked who he was and<br>where he had come from.<br><br>The monk introduced himself<br>as Sister Rani Maria's brother.<br><br>He said he wanted to speak to me.<br><br>A chill ran down my spine.<br><br>I wondered why Swamiji<br>had come to meet me<br><br>though I'd committed<br>such a terrible crime!<br><br>The next time Swamiji came, he said,<br><br>""Sister Selmi would like to<br>tie you a rakhi.""<br><br>I said,<br>""Swamiji, how is that possible?""<br><br>""How can I stand before Sister?""<br><br>""What will I say?""<br><br>""How will I explain<br>what I have done?""<br><br>On July 15, 2002, I received<br>a phone call from Swamiji.<br><br>I had never met or<br>spoken to Swamiji before that.<br><br>He asked me, ""Are you willing<br>to meet Samundar in jail?""<br><br>I replied, ""Swamiji, this is what<br>I've been waiting for.""<br><br>""I am prepared.""<br><br>July 20, 2002... Rakhi.<br><br>I didn't know much about rakhi<br><br>as it isn't a custom in Kerala.<br><br>I'd only heard about it...<br><br>knew that it signifies<br>a bond between brother and sister.<br><br>I just kept praying for Samundar<br><br>and blessing him<br>as I sat in the car.<br><br>I wasn't in the mood to speak<br>to anyone.<br><br>As soon as we reached the prison,<br>a policeman took me inside.<br><br>Another policeman<br>brought Samundar out.<br><br>I had never seen him before.<br><br>Swamiji said, ""This is Samundar.""<br><br>Samundar was trembling.<br><br>Then Swamiji introduced me<br>to Samundar,<br><br>""This is Rani Maria's<br>younger sister.""<br><br>Samundar said,<br>""Forgive me... forgive me.""<br><br>""I made a big mistake.<br>I'm repenting now.""<br><br>I said to him, ""God has already<br>forgiven you.""<br><br>""I had also forgiven you.""<br><br>""It has just taken me<br>some time to come and meet you.""<br><br>""Please be at peace.""<br><br>The police didn't give us<br>a lot of time.<br><br>So I quickly tied<br>the rakhi on his wrist.<br><br>Yes, I did.<br><br>I had brought sweets<br>from the Convent.<br><br>When I offered him some,<br><br>Samundar took it from my hand<br>and fed me a piece,<br><br>and then gave everyone a bit.<br><br>I don't know why...<br>it brought me great joy.<br><br>A brother, feeding<br>his sister sweets...<br><br>it was a blissful moment.<br><br>That was a happy day<br>and a terribly sad one, too.<br><br>There were a few moments of pure joy,<br><br>and some moments of intense grief.<br><br>Grief, because here I was, the man<br>who'd killed her elder sister.<br><br>And yet, she'd tied me a rakhi,<br><br>when in fact,<br>I don't even deserve to live.<br><br>But I had promised to accept the<br>brother-sister bond rakhi signifies.<br><br>No matter how ashamed I felt,<br><br>I had to live with it.<br><br>And then I also felt happy.<br><br>The happiness came from the fact,<br><br>that despite the crime<br>I had committed,<br><br>Sister Selmi made me her brother...<br><br>gave me another chance at life.<br><br>No sister would want her brother<br>to be in prison,<br><br>then how could I allow it.<br><br>If I have truly forgiven him then<br><br>I should not allow him<br>to be in prison.<br><br>I felt that from within.<br><br>So, I asked Swamiji, ""What can we do<br>for Samundar?""<br><br>Swamiji was already prepared.<br><br>Within months of her visit to jail,<br><br>Sister Selmi<br>with Swami Sadanand's help,<br><br>initiated legal processes<br>for the remission<br><br>of Samundar Singh's life sentence.<br><br>In the year 2006,<br><br>Samundar was released<br>from prison, permanently.<br><br>Soon after his release,<br><br>Samundar journeyed across 2000 kms,<br><br>from Madhya Pradesh to Kerala.<br><br>Samundar came home with Swamiji.<br><br>He reached Kerala.<br><br>In Kerala, I saw tears<br>in Sister Rani Maria's parents' eyes.<br><br>There were tears in her brother<br>Stephen's eyes.<br><br>I was so distressed,<br>I didn't know what to do.<br><br>I had no answers.<br><br>My mind just stopped working...<br><br>because it was beyond<br>my worst imagination.<br><br>When Samundar entered<br>my sister's room<br><br>he broke down<br>in front of her photograph.<br><br>He was inconsolable.<br><br>Then mother said,<br>""I have forgiven you completely.""<br><br>""You are my son, now.""<br><br>She accepted him as her third son.<br><br>This pond is thousands of years old.<br><br>Compared to that,<br>we humans live momentarily.<br><br>We are fortunate to be born<br>as humans.<br><br>And as humans, if we<br>behave like brutes, then...<br><br>It's impossible for me<br>to forgive myself.<br><br>What right do I have<br>to forgive myself?<br><br>No one has the right to commit<br>a crime and then forgive himself.<br><br>Yes, if you do a lot of good deeds,<br><br>there may be some redemption.<br><br>But not complete forgiveness.<br><br>Six minutes back... an explosion<br>and we have the pictures there,<br><br>on your screens as you can see.<br><br>In fact it was not an explosion<br>but you can see fire,<br><br>coming out of the top<br>of the dome of the old Taj hotel,<br><br>and a huge plume of smoke.<br><br>On that day, Oprah Winfrey was<br>gonna be on at 4 o'clock.<br><br>So I was making tea<br><br>and getting some cheese and crackers<br>ready and all of that.<br><br>And then the phone rang<br>in my mother's kitchen.<br><br>I was nearby so I just picked it up.<br><br>And it was the Managing Director<br>of Synchronicity,<br><br>Bobby Garvi.<br><br>And she said, ""Kia, you have to<br>turn on the news right away.""<br><br>And she said, ""The Oberoi hotel<br>is being attacked by terrorists.""<br><br>On 26th November, 2008,<br><br>ten members of Lashkar-e-Toiba,<br><br>an Islamic terrorist organization<br>based in Pakistan,<br><br>carried out a series<br>of co-ordinated shooting,<br><br>and bombing attacks in Mumbai.<br><br>The terrorists targeted 12 locations<br>in the southern part of the city.<br><br>These included<br>Mumbai's iconic train station,<br><br>Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus,<br><br>Cama and Albless Public Hospital<br>for Women and Children,<br><br>a popular bar and restaurant<br>called Leopold Cafe,<br><br>the Jewish Community Centre,<br><br>and two of Mumbai's<br>top five star hotels...<br><br>The Taj and the Oberoi Trident.<br><br>At first they weren't mentioning<br>Oberoi. It was all about the Taj.<br><br>But then, as it went on, they started<br>mentioning other locations.<br><br>The train station, Leopold's, and<br>then they did mention Oberoi hotel.<br><br>Kia Scherr, her husband Alan<br>and their daughter Naomi,<br><br>lived in Virginia,<br><br>and were part of a meditation<br>community called Synchronicity.<br><br>In the middle of November 2008,<br>Kia was in the US,<br><br>visiting her parents<br>for Thanksgiving,<br><br>while Alan and Naomi came to Mumbai<br>for a group meditation retreat.<br><br>The group's Indian hosts,<br>had organized their stay<br><br>at the Oberoi Trident.<br><br>And I was speculating<br>what time it was...<br><br>they must be in their rooms.<br><br>Just kept saying, ""They must be<br>in their rooms, by now.""<br><br>""I'm sure they're fine.<br>They're in their rooms.""<br><br>Late on the evening of the 26th,<br><br>Alan, Naomi and a few members<br>of the meditation group,<br><br>Helen, Michael and Linda,<br><br>had settled down to have dinner at<br>the Oberoi's Tiffin restaurant.<br><br>Much later we got another call,<br><br>from Bobby and she said that,<br><br>""This is what we know so far.""<br><br>""That everybody in the group<br>has been accounted for.""<br><br>""But... we're not sure<br>about Alan and Naomi.""<br><br>And I said, ""What do you mean?""<br><br>She said, ""Well, we know that<br>Alan took a shot to the head.""<br><br>""And Naomi was last seen hiding under<br>the table. That's what we heard...""<br><br>""But nothing's been confirmed and<br>we don't know... we don't know.""<br><br>The terrorists claimed 164 lives.<br><br>Over 300 people were injured,<br>several grievously.<br><br>The terror ended<br>after 60 agonizing hours.<br><br>6 am...<br><br>The phone rings.<br><br>Let's see... that was Friday. So it<br>would have been Friday late...<br><br>early evening,<br>late afternoon in Mumbai.<br><br>And it was a woman<br>from the US Consulate.<br><br>And she just...<br><br>I feel really bad for her that<br>she had to do this but...<br><br>that was her job and she said,<br><br>""I'm so sorry, Mrs. Scherr.""<br><br>""Your husband and daughter were both<br>shot and killed in the restaurant.""<br><br>And I couldn't believe it.<br>I said, ""Both of them?""<br><br>'Cause I figured...<br>I was kind of thinking,<br><br>""Okay, I'm going to have to accept<br>that Alan might not have made it.""<br><br>But because Naomi<br>was hiding under the table,<br><br>never in a million years<br>did I ever think...<br><br>that she, too...<br>I just couldn't believe it.<br><br>So it was like... I just kept saying,<br>""Both of them? You sure?""<br><br>And she just... what could she say.<br>She said, ""I'm so sorry.""<br><br>They're over in India and...<br>what do you...<br><br>and anyway... it's just...<br><br>Like there's nothing to say.<br>And then we just wanted to...<br><br>I don't know... for some reason<br>we just kept staring at this...<br><br>whatever information we could get.<br><br>The news...<br><br>Yes, and we still kept<br>just staring at the news,<br><br>and that's when I saw<br>for the first time,<br><br>the face of Ajmal Kasab.<br><br>This young man... holding the gun<br>at the train station.<br><br>As the city laid its martyrs to rest,<br><br>a bustling metropolis<br>was plunged into mourning.<br><br>I think it was so big. I...<br><br>just a state of shock and you go into<br>a surreal kind of a state,<br><br>because it was too big<br>to even process really.<br><br>Of course, I broke down and cried,<br><br>but I wasn't sobbing constantly<br>for days<br><br>because I couldn't, I was in shock.<br><br>But then I had to go and...<br>pack up things.<br><br>I had to look at photographs<br>and stuffed animals,<br><br>and drawings and books, clothing...<br><br>and I had to do all of that.<br><br>And there was this giveaway shed,<br><br>near where we were living,<br><br>where you could just<br>bring things in the shed,<br><br>and people could go take what they<br>needed and they might bring things.<br><br>One day I went with a box<br>of Naomi's clothes.<br><br>And there was a woman there and she<br>recognized me from the newspaper,<br><br>and she knew exactly...<br><br>I'd never met her before.<br><br>And she just looked at that box<br><br>cause it was sort of still open<br>on top and saw,<br><br>t-shirts and jeans<br>and all this and...<br><br>She said, ""I know you.""<br><br>And she just gave me a big hug.<br><br>Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus<br><br>had suffered the maximum number of<br>casualties during the terror attack.<br><br>Ajmal Amir Kasab,<br>who with his partner,<br><br>had killed 58 people<br>at the train terminus,<br><br>was the lone terrorist<br>captured alive.<br><br>Q: What is the name<br>of your organization?<br><br>Kasab: Lashkar-e-Toiba.<br><br>Q: Any other organization?<br><br>Kasab: No,<br>just Mujahideen Lashkar-e-Toiba.<br><br>Q: Who are your family members?<br>Kasab: My mother, my sister.<br><br>Q: What's your mother's name?<br>Kasab: Noor Ilahee.<br><br>Q: What's your father's name?<br>Kasab: Amir.<br><br>What was his occupation?<br><br>He sold street food in our village<br><br>and then in Lahore.<br><br>But he couldn't make ends meet.<br><br>Q: How much have you studied?<br><br>Kasab: I studied till<br>the fourth grade.<br><br>Q: What did you do<br>after leaving school?<br><br>Kasab: I started working<br>as a labourer.<br><br>I first worked in the village<br>and then in Lahore.<br><br>I lifted cement and bricks...<br><br>Q: You were on a building site?<br><br>Yes. But I was not getting<br>enough work to make a living.<br><br>Then my father introduced me<br>to the Lashkar-e-Toiba.<br><br>Q: How?<br><br>My father said,<br><br>""Look son, we are very poor.<br>If you work with them,""<br><br>""you will earn enough money to live<br>comfortably like them.""<br><br>""It's not difficult.""<br><br>""We will get money.<br>We won't remain poor.""<br><br>""Your siblings will be<br>able to get married.""<br><br>""Look son""<br><br>""you will also earn<br>and live comfortably like they do.""<br><br>Q: How did they describe Jihad<br>to you?<br><br>""It's honourable,<br>it's like serving God.""<br><br>That's what they said.<br><br>Q: If you hadn't been captured<br>by the police,<br><br>you would have died, isn't it?<br><br>Q: Why were you ready<br>to sacrifice your life?<br><br>Q: Surely it was something<br>more than money.<br><br>Sir, it's nothing other than poverty.<br>Poverty is a terrible thing.<br><br>When you have nothing to eat, nothing<br>to wear, what else can you do?<br><br>Q: How much did they transfer<br>to your account?<br><br>I don't have an account.<br>They paid my father.<br><br>Q: How much did they give him?<br><br>I don't know, may be lakhs.<br><br>Q: Do you think your father has<br>this much money right now?<br><br>Maybe... he might.<br><br>Q: So, your father used you, right?<br><br>Kasab: Whatever you say, sir.<br><br>Q: You were here for Jihad, right?<br><br>What Jihad, sir!<br><br>Look, there is no point crying now.<br><br>Just tell us the whole truth.<br><br>As you say, sir.<br><br>Q: How many shots did you fire?<br><br>Kasab: I don't know.<br>We just kept firing.<br><br>Q: Whom were you told to kill?<br><br>Q: For how long did you<br>plan to operate today?<br><br>They ordered us, ""Until you're alive<br>keep firing, dogs!""<br><br>Q: That's what they said? Yes!<br><br>We are also human beings!<br><br>I wasn't sure<br>where I was going to go.<br><br>So, I was in limbo<br>for about six months.<br><br>I spent my days...<br>journaling a bit, taking walks.<br><br>I started answering the e-mails<br>that had come in.<br><br>Something about what happened<br>with Alan and Naomi's photos...<br><br>it became very personal.<br><br>And people felt for that loss<br>and wanted to reach out,<br><br>and express those feelings to me.<br><br>They came from India, Pakistan<br>and South America and...<br><br>There were like close<br>to a thousand of them.<br><br>""Alan and Naomi will live forever<br>in all of us.""<br><br>""This is not a time<br>for expressing hate,""<br><br>but a time for strength...<br><br>to show the whole world<br>we stand united,<br><br>""and never surrender to those<br>who kill in the name of Islam.""<br><br>""Your Iranian family.""<br><br>There was something...<br><br>very precious happening.<br><br>Something got ignited<br>in people's hearts.<br><br>On the first anniversary<br>of the terror attack,<br><br>Kia and members<br>of her meditation community,<br><br>articulated a response<br>to the violence.<br><br>It was honouring the oneness of life,<br><br>In the summer of 2010, I was...<br><br>thinking a lot about...<br><br>I wanted to introduce this to India.<br><br>It was important for the people<br>of Mumbai to know about this.<br><br>And I wanted to invite<br>the support of Mr. Oberoi.<br><br>So I sent him an e-mail,<br><br>called,<br><br>we chatted,<br><br>and he invited me to be his guest.<br><br>On the 26th of November 2010,<br><br>Kia marked the second anniversary<br>of the terror attack,<br><br>with a peace program<br>at the Oberoi Trident,<br><br>where she spoke about<br>forgiving the terrorists.<br><br>Intuitively, I felt,<br><br>that we must forgive them,<br>they know not what they do.<br><br>And I am not saying<br><br>that I even knew<br>what forgiveness was in that context.<br><br>Because there wasn't anybody<br>to really forgive.<br><br>It wasn't a personal thing at all.<br><br>It was much bigger than that.<br><br>It was a much bigger<br>kind of forgiveness.<br><br>I just want to share<br>with you something that<br><br>I learned about<br>what forgiveness actually is.<br><br>It's not about the other person.<br><br>It's not about releasing<br>anybody else.<br><br>So, it's not about pardoning anybody,<br><br>or condoning something.<br>Or letting anybody off the hook.<br><br>It's about releasing yourself,<br><br>from holding negative thoughts<br>and feelings.<br><br>I have gone through my peace,<br>inner peace is here.<br><br>I know how to forgive people.<br><br>My mom struggles,<br><br>and she is sitting right there.<br><br>She is in tears<br>thinking about all that.<br><br>To be unforgiving,<br>is like taking poison,<br><br>and hoping your enemy dies.<br><br>But we're the ones<br>that have taken the poison.<br><br>After 2010,<br><br>Kia returned to India every year,<br>to work on initiatives,<br><br>that attempted<br>to dissolve boundaries,<br><br>and foster peace<br>in a variety of ways.<br><br>Inspired by Kia,<br><br>students of the suburban<br>St. Andrews College,<br><br>took up an educational project<br><br>with children from<br>underprivileged backgrounds.<br><br>They wanted to bring<br>educational programmes,<br><br>and help them<br>with their computer skills,<br><br>and Math and learning English.<br><br>Lots of them showed up, for about<br>ten weeks every Sunday.<br><br>This is little Anjun.<br><br>I was sitting next to her.<br><br>It was English lesson.<br>We were just practicing,<br><br>""What is your name?""<br><br>""Where are you from?""<br><br>You know, standard questions,<br>and then...<br><br>""Do you have a husband<br>and do you have children?""<br><br>Then she was...<br><br>So I thought, well, might as well<br>just tell her the truth.<br><br>I said,""Yes, but my husband<br>and my daughter,<br><br>were both killed<br>in 26/11 terror attacks.""<br><br>Her eyes got really wide<br>and she just said, ""Oh, no!""<br><br>And then she wanted to know<br>more about my daughter.<br><br>I said, ""She was thirteen and<br>next week is her birthday...""<br><br>on Friday.""<br><br>Friday came...<br><br>the day of Naomi's birthday.<br><br>I had a quiet day<br>and that night I was in bed,<br><br>and about 10:30 in the evening<br>the phone rings.<br><br>So, I answered the phone and...<br><br>""Hello, ma'am!""<br><br>""Anjun?""<br><br>""Yes, ma'am.""<br><br>I said, ""Anjun.

apply to a black hole<br><br>if there is any presence<br><br>of something here on earth<br><br>such as<br><br>gravity.<br><br>- Gravity.<br><br>Oh, so that's what<br>Google was talking about<br><br>when I looked it up earlier.<br><br>- Yes,<br><br>the same gravity that<br>takes this beautiful dart<br><br>to the black<br><br>hole of that<br><br>gaping bullseye.<br><br>Right in the

holes again?<br><br>- Just because we<br>identify as nerds<br><br>doesn't mean you<br>can call us nerds.<br><br>We can call each other nerds.<br><br>You can't call us nerds.<br><br>Nerd.<br><br>- Hey, nerd.<br><br>- Hey.<br><br>- Yes, we're talking<br>about black holes.<br><br>- Man, you guys talk<br>about black holes<br><br>more than Robert Pinero.<br><br>- Hold on.<br><br>He's doing that<br>comedy thing again.<br><br>Because<br><br>Robert De Niro,<br><br>Bobby as I call him,<br><br>he likes black women.<br><br>So that is funny.<br><br>- Bobby of Niro<br><br>likes black.<br><br>- Jesus guys.<br><br>Seriously.<br><br>But I'll play along.<br><br>- Oh.<br><br>- So,<br><br>let's just say the guy<br>particle accelerator<br><br>and taken out all these<br>mini black holes.<br><br>- Yes, you're<br>speaking my language.<br><br>- They go ahead and toss us<br><br>into the Mandela Effect.<br><br>Mandela Effect.<br><br>The Mandela Effect refers to<br>an enlarged number of people<br><br>share a false memory,<br><br>originally attributed<br>to the existence<br><br>of multiple universes.<br><br>Are we currently residing in it?<br><br>- Let's see.<br><br>Answer the question.<br><br>- Bernstein.<br><br>I guess you could<br>be a possibility.<br><br>Next question.<br><br>- It could be a possibility.<br><br>- But.<br><br>- If only you were to believe

question<br>for you guys.<br><br>You think<br><br>- because.<br>- Yes.<br><br>- These black holes opening,<br><br>toss us into an<br>alternate universe<br><br>within ourselves<br><br>that we actually have<br>non binary people.<br><br>People who do not identify<br><br>as either gender,<br><br>nor masculine, nor feminine.<br><br>That they see neither of them.<br><br>That however they exist<br>outside the binary,<br><br>and outside the cis normativity.<br><br>I'm telling you some people<br><br>do not see gender, but just see<br><br>who they actually<br>are as a person.<br><br>- See

Okay.<br><br>- A couple reasons why<br>Greese 2 is shit.<br><br>First of all,<br><br>Michelle Phieffer sounds like<br><br>she's got a dead cat<br>stuck in her throat.<br><br>Her singing is atrocious.<br><br>- And yet she persevered.<br><br>- That was easily<br>the worst movie<br><br>she's ever been in.<br><br>Secondly, there's a<br>production going on right now<br><br>called 13.<br><br>These kids are in junior high<br><br>and they're putting<br>on something better<br><br>than these 30 year olds could.<br><br>Last,<br><br>these four musicals<br><br>were on a

Greese<br><br>instead of the wrong one.<br><br>If they would have<br>got their heads<br><br>out of their asses,<br><br>they would have<br>picked the right one,<br><br>they would have<br>found a cool rider<br><br>and Harold would have obliged.<br><br>- So what are you<br>drinking there?<br><br>- Young lady, I am not drinking<br><br>anything.<br><br>I am experiencing this<br><br>single malt scotch.<br><br>- You know,<br><br>every time you drink scotch,<br><br>it makes me really frisky.<br><br>- Well I do suppose that the<br><br>experience is different<br>for everyone.<br><br>- Well what are you doing later?<br><br>- Young lady,<br><br>must I inform you<br><br>that I'm wearing my purity ring.<br><br>- Why are you wearing<br>a purity ring?<br><br>- Because<br><br>purity rings are so cool.<br><br>- Cousin Harold.<br><br>Are you doubting the<br><br>coolness of my purity ring?<br><br>- Well if your ear wolf hat<br><br>is an indication,<br><br>yes, I am.<br><br>I've decided that purity rings<br><br>are no longer.<br><br>- Well then they are no<br>longer hip for the Oliver.<br><br>Young lady may entice away.<br><br>- Do you want to experience<br>my place or yours later?<br><br>- Oh, Oliver does not<br>want to wait that long.<br><br>How about<br><br>out back behind the dumpster?<br><br>- Dumpster fucking?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>- Oliver,<br><br>please.<br><br>- Oh

You how I feel about<br>those tractor shots.<br><br>It's just kind of like,<br><br>actually that guy up there<br><br>on the TV.<br><br>He seems like a guy who<br>probably put himself<br><br>in his own

anymore.<br><br>- What happened?<br><br>- Well he pirated pornography.<br><br>I can't stand for that.<br><br>I mean when you<br>sell pornography,<br><br>you have to pay the taxes,<br><br>the rights,<br><br>all these different<br>fees towards it.<br><br>He didn't do that.<br><br>That's not right.<br><br>People spend a lot<br>of time and money<br><br>making pornography.<br><br>They should be paid<br><br>a living wage for such things.<br><br>Yeah, so he was<br>pirating pornography<br><br>all over town.<br><br>And I found out about it<br><br>and I had to let I'm go.<br><br>Broke his heart.<br><br>He loved that job.<br><br>- He did love that job.<br><br>Man, this whole time,<br><br>everybody thought you<br>were morally bankrupt.<br><br>I guess we were just<br>in a recession.<br><br>- Irony isn't it.<br><br>- Now you say it,<br><br>now I do remember<br>something about it.<br><br>I heard his house got raided.<br><br>Like the police came in,<br><br>swat team came in<br><br>and they found some<br>stuff in the basement.<br><br>- I didn't hear about this.<br><br>What?<br><br>- He had an archive<br>of secret things.<br><br>I mean it was almost<br>like Donnie Darko<br><br>and you realize Patrick Swayze<br><br>had like the<br><br>kiddie porn dungeon in there.<br><br>It wasn't like that.<br><br>It was a whole nother thing.<br><br>Raider porn.<br><br>- What's raider?<br><br>I've never heard<br>of a Raider porn.<br><br>What's Raider porn?<br><br>- It's when white supremacists<br><br>have furry parties<br><br>and they bang each other<br><br>and film it.<br><br>- But wait a minute.<br><br>How many animals in<br>the animal kingdom<br><br>are actually white?<br><br>- Like a snow leopard.<br><br>- You got doves.<br><br>Like an albino squirrel maybe.<br><br>- God man, a polar bear.<br><br>- Polar bear.<br><br>- Polar bear.<br><br>Yeah, polar bear.<br><br>- You know when it's<br>white supremacists<br><br>is all in the<br>missionary position.<br><br>So it's gonna be boring as hell.<br><br>- But wait a minute,<br><br>if a brown bear comes in<br><br>it just kind of throws<br>the whole thing off.<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>They ain't letting this guy in.<br><br>Come on.<br><br>- Imagine he walks in,<br><br>do you mind if I dance<br>with your dates?<br><br>- Oh come on,<br><br>they're gonna worry about it.<br><br>They're gonna produce<br>some sort of skunk baby<br><br>in their minds.<br><br>Come on man.<br><br>That ain't gonna happen.<br><br>- Imagine a neo-Nazi<br><br>mid stroke in the<br>middle of raider porn<br><br>and a black bear walks in.<br><br>Allah, adult shop mop<br><br>and I'm soft.<br><br>- I mean hand job<br><br>even just,<br><br>I watch you, you watch me.<br><br>I would<br><br>eat ass,<br><br>but that would be like<br><br>eating at Benny Hannas<br><br>from the looks of things.<br><br>- Seriously?<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>For serious, oh big time.<br><br>- This is the best you can<br>do to pick up a girl?<br><br>- I mean,<br><br>the next one is either<br>pull out a wallet<br><br>or get you in one of my dad's<br>Nissan's or something.<br><br>I don't know<br><br>what you're currently,<br><br>your like current APR is<br><br>or what your<br><br>as far as lease<br>goes or anything,<br><br>but I can get you a car.<br><br>I can get you money.<br><br>Some fake titties, or something.<br><br>Whatever you want,<br><br>I would do it for you.<br><br>- Dude, I am too good for you.<br><br>- There's only one<br>way to find out.<br><br>And a lot of times,<br><br>like the big trend right now<br><br>I've seen online is for women<br><br>to like carry men.<br><br>I can be that piece<br>of shit boyfriend<br><br>that all your<br>friends joke about.<br><br>And you know, really though,<br><br>when you come home,<br><br>I'm...<br><br>- Dude, I've been<br>there, done that, so.<br><br>- You haven't done<br>this yet tough.<br><br>- Raider porn.<br><br>There's actually raider porn.<br><br>That's not a joke?<br><br>- No dude.<br><br>I'm dead serious.<br><br>- Why the hell did he have<br>raider porn in his basement?<br><br>- I don't know man.<br><br>He had like some weird, sick<br>little obsession in there.<br><br>And he kept going with it.<br><br>- And the cops<br><br>came for it.<br><br>Oh god.<br><br>- They did dude.<br><br>- Oh my god.<br><br>I bet his nice little<br>Methodist mother<br><br>lost it when she saw<br>the cops showing up<br><br>to get his raider<br>porn collection.<br><br>- He was always in to like<br><br>weird figure skating,<br><br>but maybe because it's like<br><br>usually white petite girls.<br><br>- Well he was an interesting,<br><br>he was an interesting duck.<br><br>- Always kind of floating<br>through the air,<br><br>maybe like a bird.<br><br>- A strange kid, a strange kid.<br><br>But,<br><br>I can forgive all that.<br><br>But you don't pirate pornography<br><br>because people are<br>not being paid<br><br>the proper taxes,<br>fees and residuals<br><br>that they are entitled to.<br><br>But raider porn,<br><br>that's a bridge too far.<br><br>- Oh my god.<br><br>Look at this sack of shit.<br><br>Look at him.<br><br>- Oh Christ.<br><br>That is worse than<br><br>having raider porn is being<br>a stand up comedian.<br><br>- I heard that porno<br>Pete was actually<br><br>saying that he was<br>watching that stuff<br><br>to build up a stand<br>up comedy act.<br><br>- So his<br><br>excuse was I have a raider<br>porn collection to...<br><br>- Work on a bit.<br><br>- To work on a bit.<br><br>I think I'd rather<br>be a porn hound<br><br>than be a stand up comedian.<br><br>That is like the<br>lowest of the low.<br><br>- God, can you imagine what<br>it would have been like<br><br>if we had to go around like<br><br>the community...<br><br>- You had to go door to door<br><br>and tell everybody<br>he was a standup.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>I'm Pete, I live down at...<br><br>- I live within your community.<br><br>- Oh my god.<br><br>What was his Methodist<br>more upset about?<br><br>The fact that he was<br><br>peddling porn and<br>pirating it all over town<br><br>or that he's gonna be<br>a stand up comedian?<br><br>- Dude, I don't know.<br><br>It's got.<br><br>Oh my god.<br><br>- Speaking, yeah, Jesus,<br><br>speaking of the devil,<br><br>look at that sack of shit.<br><br>Oh my god.<br><br>- Oh my god.<br><br>How embarrassing would that be.<br><br>- See,<br><br>I bet his parents are so proud.<br><br>Oh my god.<br><br>- Oh yeah, definitely.<br><br>That guys is just driving like<br><br>a red mustang<br><br>with a canvas top convertible.<br><br>Not even a V8, a V6.<br><br>Automatic.<br><br>- It was a V8.<br><br>I hope I'm never<br><br>that low that I have to<br>do something like that<br><br>to garner attention.<br><br>- Oh dude.<br><br>I'd rather be sucking dick<br>from behind in the alley<br><br>making decent wage off of that<br><br>than to ever have to<br>speak any kind of<br><br>words into a microphone.<br><br>- Matt, please, let's<br>make a promise<br><br>that we never, ever have<br>to do standup comedy.<br><br>- Yeah.<br><br>- Real quick, bathroom,<br>three

stuff.<br><br>- Indeed rather have the<br>Bros two times over<br><br>than I'd have you.<br><br>- That'd probably<br>feel about the same.<br><br>You got a little<br><br>nubby nubby in each hand.<br><br>A little corn holder.<br><br>If that's what you want,<br><br>I'll arrange it.<br><br>I know them.<br><br>- They don't like you though.<br><br>- No one really<br>does, but I mean.<br><br>- Then why are you here?<br><br>If no one likes you,<br>then why are you here?<br><br>Why don't you go fuck off?<br><br>Back to Douche land?<br><br>- I will do that.<br><br>If you change your mind,<br><br>- I'll be over here.<br>- I won't.<br><br>- That's okay.<br><br>- You might.<br>- So fuck off.<br><br>- I've got that thing<br><br>in the back of your mind.<br><br>You'll be thinking about it.<br><br>- Nope.<br>- Think about it.<br><br>- Fuck off.<br><br>- God.<br><br>I can't get any pussy<br>in this place.<br><br>I might as well go fucking<br>kings and queens.<br><br>- Jesus Christ dude,<br><br>you're objectifying that sliz.<br><br>- What does that even mean?<br><br>Objectifying?<br><br>You sound like one<br>of those broads man.<br><br>- You know,<br><br>loose
