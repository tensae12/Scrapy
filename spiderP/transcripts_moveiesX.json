Personal dramas and a murder mystery unfold in present-day Budapest, where demonstrations are part of the pre-election life of a city still trying to cope with the shadows of its historical and recent past.

All right.<br><br>So?<br><br>It's gonna be close.<br>A vote this loaded is always close.<br><br>What about the UN summit?<br>The world will be watching.<br><br>- Maybe you could use it to your advantage.<br>- We're Americans, Henry.<br><br>Let the rest of the damn world<br>deal with mutants in their own way.<br><br>You know this situation? These mutants?<br><br>People like this Jean Grey?<br>If it were up to me, I'd lock 'em all away.<br><br>It's a war.<br><br>It's the reason people like me exist.<br><br>Where the hell are we?<br><br>Pilot!<br><br>People like you are the reason<br>I was afraid to go to school as a child.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>- For what?<br>- If I hurt you.<br><br>So... couldn't wait<br>to get my shirt off again, huh?<br><br>The metal is an alloy called adamantium.<br><br>Supposedly indestructible. It's been<br>surgically grafted to his entire skeleton.<br><br>How could he have survived<br>a procedure like that?<br><br>His mutation. He has<br>uncharted regenerative capability<br><br>which enables him to heal rapidly.<br><br>This also makes his age<br>impossible to determine.<br><br>He could very well be older than you,<br>Professor.<br><br>- Who did this to him?<br>- He doesn't know.<br><br>Nor does he remember anything<br>about his life before it happened.<br><br>Experimentation on mutants.<br>It's not unheard of.<br><br>But I've never seen anything<br>like this before.<br><br>What do you think Magneto want with him?<br><br>I'm not entirely sure it's him<br>Magneto wants.<br><br>Toad has a wicked tongue, Senator.<br><br>Just like you.<br><br>Who are you people? Where's Henry?<br><br>Mr Guyrich has been dead<br>for some time, Senator.<br><br>But I've had Mystique here keep you<br>company. She takes so many shapes.<br><br>Whatever you do to me,<br>you'll make me right.<br><br>Every word I've spoken will be confirmed.<br><br>Are you a God-fearing man, Senator?<br>It's such a strange phrase.<br><br>I've always thought of God as a teacher.<br><br>As a bringer of light,<br>wisdom and understanding.<br><br>You see,<br>I think what you really are afraid of is me.<br><br>Me and my kind.<br>The brotherhood of mutants.<br><br>It's not so surprising, really. Mankind has<br>always feared what it doesn't understand.<br><br>Well, don't fear God, Senator,<br>and certainly don't fear me.<br><br>Not any more.<br><br>- What do you intend to do to me?<br>- Let's just say God works too slowly.<br><br>I think you'll be comfortable here.<br><br>- Where's your room?<br>- With Scott, down the hall.<br><br>Is that your gift?

What kinds of things?<br><br>All kinds of things.<br><br>- I also have telepathic ability.<br>- Like your professor?<br><br>Nowhere near that powerful.<br>But he's teaching me to develop it.<br><br>I'm sure he is.<br><br>- So read my mind.<br>- I'd rather not.<br><br>- Come on. You afraid you might like it?<br>- I doubt it.<br><br>What do you see?<br><br>Scott!<br><br>Good night, Logan.<br><br>You gonna tell me<br>to stay away from your girl?<br><br>If I had to do that, she wouldn't be my girl.<br><br>Then I guess you've got nothing<br>to worry about, do you... Cyclops?<br><br>It must just burn you up<br>that a boy like me saved your life, huh?<br><br>You oughta be careful.<br>I might not be there next time.<br><br>Oh, and Logan, stay away from my girl.<br><br>Logan?<br><br>Logan! Logan, wake up.<br><br>Help me!<br><br>Somebody, help!<br><br>Scott, grab a pillow.<br><br>It was an accident.<br><br>- Logan?<br>- What happened?<br><br>- Is she all right?<br>- She'll be all right.<br><br>- What did she do to me?<br>- When Rogue touches someone,<br><br>she takes their energy, their life force.<br><br>In the case of mutants,<br>she absorbs their gifts for a while.<br><br>In your case, your ability to heal.<br><br>It felt like she almost killed me.<br><br>If she'd held out any longer,<br>she could have.<br><br>How are we feeling, Senator?<br>Advanced, I hope.<br><br>What the hell have you done to me?<br><br>Senator, this is pointless.<br>Where would you go?<br><br>Who would take you in,<br>now you're one of us?<br><br>Tommy, let it go!

They say<br>you're stealing other mutants' powers.<br><br>No!

It's strange.<br><br>There are more powerful mutants out there.<br>Why should this one be so important to him?<br><br>- Maybe it's his way with people.<br>- You don't like him.<br><br>- How could you tell?<br>- Well, I am psychic, you know.<br><br>- Where is she?<br>- Who?<br><br>Rogue.<br><br>She's gone.<br><br>Welcome, Professor.<br><br>Welcome to Cerebro.<br><br>This certainly is a big, round room.<br><br>The brain waves of mutants<br>are different from average humans.<br><br>This device amplifies my power, allowing me<br>to locate mutants across great distances.<br><br>- That's how I intend to find Rogue.<br>- Why don't you just use it to find Magneto?<br><br>I've been trying, but he's found<br>some way to shield himself from it.<br><br>How would he know how to do that?<br><br>Because he helped me build it.<br><br>Now if you'll excuse me...<br><br>Have you ever...?<br><br>Used Cerebro?<br><br>No.<br><br>It takes a degree of control and...<br>for someone like me, it's...<br><br>Dangerous.<br><br>...now boarding at track 4.<br><br>- She's at the station.<br>- Where is it?<br><br>A few miles west of here.<br>You can't leave the mansion.<br><br>It's the opportunity Magneto needs.<br><br>- Listen, I'm the reason she took off.<br>- We had a deal.<br><br>She's all right. She's just upset.<br><br>Storm, Cyclops, find her.<br>See if you can talk to her.<br><br>- What?<br>- Where's my motorcycle?<br><br>Hey, kid.<br><br>I'm sorry about last night.<br><br>Me, too.<br><br>You running again?<br><br>I heard the professor was mad at me.<br><br>- Who told you that?<br>- A boy at school.<br><br>- When's the last time you saw her?<br>- She was supposed to meet me for lunch.<br><br>You look around,<br>I'll check with the ticket agent.<br><br>Welcome, Professor.<br><br>- You think I should go back.<br>- I think you should follow your instincts.<br><br>The first boy I ever kissed<br>ended up in a coma for three weeks.<br><br>I can still feel him inside my head.<br><br>And it's the same with you.<br><br>There's not many people that'll understand<br>what you're going through.<br><br>But I think this guy Xavier's one of them.<br><br>He seems to genuinely wanna help you.<br><br>And that's a rare thing.<br><br>For people like us.<br><br>OK, so...<br><br>What do you say?<br>Give these geeks one more shot?<br><br>Come on, I'll take care of you.<br><br>- You promise?<br>- Yeah.<br><br>Yeah, I promise.<br><br>Come along now.

My dear boy!<br><br>Whoever said I wanted you?<br><br>Young people!<br><br>All right, hold it! Hold it right there.<br><br>Stay where you are.<br>Put your hands over your heads. Now!<br><br>You Homo sapiens and your guns.<br><br>- That's enough, Eric.<br>- Let them go.<br><br>Why not come out where I can see you,<br>Charles?<br><br>What do you want her for?<br><br>Can't you read my mind?<br><br>What now? Save the girl?<br><br>You'll have to kill me, Charles.<br>And what will that accomplish?<br><br>Let them pass that law and they'll have you<br>in chains with a number on your forehead.<br><br>- It won't be that way.<br>- Then kill me and find out.<br><br>No? Then release me.<br><br>Fine!<br><br>Care to press your luck, Charles?<br><br>I don't think I can stop them all.<br><br>Still unwilling to make sacrifices.<br>That's what makes you weak.<br><br>Goodbye, Charles.<br><br>- You said he wanted me.<br>- I made a terrible mistake.<br><br>His helmet was somehow designed<br>to block my telepathy.<br><br>Couldn't see what he was after<br>till it was too late.<br><br>- Where are you going?<br>- To find her.<br><br>- How?<br>- The traditional way: look.<br><br>- Logan, you can't do this alone.<br>- Who'll help me? You?<br><br>- So far, you've all done a bang-up job.<br>- Then help us. Fight with us.<br><br>Fight with you? Join the team?<br>Be an X-Man?<br><br>Who the hell do you think you are?<br>You're a mutant.<br><br>The world is full of people<br>that hate and fear you<br><br>and you're wasting your time trying<br>to protect them. I got better things to do.<br><br>You know, Magneto's right.<br>There's a war coming.<br><br>- Are you sure you're on the right side?<br>- At least I've chosen a side.<br><br>I'm looking for Dr Jean Grey.<br><br>Senator Kelly.<br><br>I'm Professor Charles Xavier.<br><br>I was afraid if I went to hospital,<br>they would...<br><br>Treat you like a mutant?<br><br>We're not what you think.

But I fear it will<br>harm any normal person exposed to it.<br><br>- So what does Magneto want with Rogue?<br>- I don't know.<br><br>Wait a second. You said this machine<br>draws its power from Magneto.<br><br>- And that it weakened him.<br>- Yes. In fact, it nearly killed him.<br><br>He's going to transfer his power to Rogue<br>and use her to power the machine.<br><br>Is somebody there?<br><br>Yes. I'm here.<br><br>Please don't leave me!<br><br>I don't want to be alone.<br><br>All right.<br><br>Do you hate normal people?<br><br>Sometimes.<br><br>Why?<br><br>I suppose...<br><br>I'm afraid of them.<br><br>Well...<br><br>I think you've got one less person...<br>to be afraid of.<br><br>Cyclops, you and Storm ready the jet.<br>I'm gonna find Rogue. Get Logan a uniform.<br><br>Wait a minute.<br>He's not coming with us, is he?<br><br>- Yes.<br>- Sorry, but he'll endanger the mission and...<br><br>I wasn't the one who gave the station<br>a new sunroof, pal.<br><br>No, you were the one<br>who stabbed Rogue in the chest.<br><br>Why don't you take your little mission<br>and stick it up...<br><br>Senator Kelly is dead.<br><br>I'm going to find her.<br><br>Settle this.<br><br>I'm sorry.<br><br>You can still hear me... can't you?<br><br>You've taught me everything in my life<br>that was ever worth knowing.<br><br>And if anything happens...<br><br>I'll take care of them.<br><br>Jean?<br><br>Jean!<br><br>No!<br><br>Jean?<br><br>Jean.<br><br>Answer me. Please.<br><br>I know where Magneto's going.<br><br>Magnificent, isn't she?<br><br>- I've seen it.<br>- I first saw her in 1949.<br><br>America was going to be<br>the land of tolerance. Of peace.<br><br>Are you going to kill me?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>- Why?<br>- Because there is no land of tolerance.<br><br>There is no peace, not here<br>or anywhere else.<br><br>Whole families destroyed simply<br><br>because they were born different<br>from those in power.<br><br>Well, after tonight,<br>the world's powerful will be just like us.<br><br>They will return home as brothers.<br><br>As mutants.<br><br>Our cause will be theirs.<br><br>Your sacrifice will mean our survival.<br><br>I'll understand<br>if that comes as small consolation.<br><br>Put her in the machine.<br><br>I'll raise it.<br><br>Magneto is here - Liberty Island.<br><br>Presumably his objective is to mutate the<br>world leaders at the summit on Ellis Island.<br><br>He doesn't know his machine kills,<br>and judging from what the professor saw<br><br>if Magneto gave Rogue enough power, he<br>could wipe out everyone in New York City.<br><br>All right.

One day, a mutant by the name of Nightcrawler infiltrates the White House and attempts to assassinate the president, setting off a chain reaction of anti-mutant measures by the government. Meanwhile, Logan is trying to discover his past. As scientist named William Stryker discovers Professor X's secret school and Cerebro, Magneto's partner, Mystique, is planning to break her leader out of prison. But when Professor X's school is attacked by Stryker's forces, Logan, Rogue, Iceman and a few are lucky to escape. Those who remain meet in Boston, where they form an uneasy alliance with Magneto to stop Stryker and rescue Professor X.", "transcript": ["<div class=\"full-script\">Encoded by Judas<br>Enjoy!<br><br>Mutants.

Perhaps you better<br>see the parents, they're outside.<br><br>- Replaced the dressings, nurse, will you?<br>- Yes, Doctor.<br><br>What's wrong with him, Doctor?<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Is there anything you can tell<br>us, Doctor?<br><br>Well, I'm afraid it's a<br>little early yet, to...<br><br>Your son has been badly burned.<br><br>- If you could tell us how or...<br>- Burned, burned by what?<br><br>That's what we're trying to find out.<br><br>When did you first notice anything?<br><br>- It was this morning.<br>- I went into his room to wake him up.<br><br>He was lying there with those<br>horrible marks all over him.<br><br>Well, yesterday,<br>what happened yesterday?<br><br>- Where did he go, do you know?<br>- We don't know.<br><br>He stopped out late with a friend of<br>his, Ian Osborne.<br><br>Ask him.<br><br>He'll be able to tell you<br>where they were last night.<br><br>Oh, Ian, just a moment.<br><br>Somebody wants to meet you, Ian.<br><br>Ian...<br><br>this is Dr. Royston.<br><br>- Dr. Royston, this is Ian Osborn.<br>- How are you, Ian?<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Let's sit down, Ian.<br><br>Now, I've just come from visiting<br>your friend, Willie Harding.<br><br>He's not very well, Ian.<br><br>What's wrong with him?<br><br>Well, you know, you and he were<br>out late last night, weren't you?<br><br>And something must have<br>happened to him where you were.<br><br>I'd like you to<br>tell me what it was.<br><br>Where did you go, Ian?<br><br>Where was it, Ian?<br><br>I can not tell you.<br><br>We swore an oath.<br><br>Willie is sick.<br><br>He's very sick, Ian.<br><br>I can't, I can't, we swore an oath.<br><br>Yes, yes, but that was when Willie<br>was fit and healthy, wasn't it?<br><br>Wasn't it?<br><br>Now that he's sick, see, that's<br>different, he'd want you to tell.<br><br>Are you sure?<br><br>I'm very sure.<br><br>Well, we went out to the<br>tower in the marshes.<br><br>It was awfully creepy.<br><br>I dared Willie to go to the tower.<br><br>Hello, anybody there?<br><br>Mister.<br><br>Wake up, mister!<br><br>What is it... what, what, what is it?<br><br>Oh! Look at the waste.<br><br>- You care for a dram?<br>- No, no thank you.<br><br>- I came out here because...<br>- Oh, come on man, have a dram.<br><br>That container, that's mine, it came<br>from my workshop. Where did you get it?<br><br>- This? I found it lying about...<br>- Don't touch it!<br><br>Here man, mind what you're up to!<br><br>Stay away from that!<br>You touch it, and it may kill you.<br><br>Come in.<br><br>- Good evening, sir.<br>- Hello, Peter.<br><br>I can see what you<br>meant on the phone.<br><br>- Is it safe?<br>- Unfortunately, yes.<br><br>- This is lead, isn't it?<br>- Half an inch thick.<br><br>There's a sort of...<br><br>I know, I found the same<br>thing up at the tower.<br><br>There's a towel there.<br><br>You won't be able to wipe it off, Peter.<br><br>It'll just disappear in an hour or two.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>Well, whatever it is,<br>it's all over the place.<br><br>How do you explain it, sir?<br><br>All this extraordinary damage just<br>to steal on old sample container.<br><br>Do you know what's in that<br>container, Peter?<br><br>It's Tritium.<br><br>Don't be alarmed now,<br>it's completely harmless.<br><br>And how long would you say<br>Tritium retains its radioactivity?<br><br>It's not a very stable<br>compound, about 30 years.<br><br>28 actually,<br>now take a radiation reading.<br><br>No, the counters working all<br>right, here, look.<br><br>Just the luminous paint on my watch.<br><br>What happened, sir?<br>I don't understand.<br><br>Peter, I'm afraid I don't either.<br><br>Yesterday the material<br>on that container was<br><br>giving a danger point<br>radiation reading.<br><br>- Now as you just saw, it's nothing.<br>- But that's impossible!<br><br>Isn't it?<br><br>Yesterday I would have said yes,<br>but this fact is inescapable.<br><br>The energy trapped in that Tritium<br>has been sucked right out of it.<br><br>And furthermore, these windows were<br>barred and that door was locked all night.<br><br>So, whoever it was came in here must be...<br><br>most unusual.<br><br>- Really, Inspector McGill.<br>- Tristen.<br><br>I'm sorry, but the whole<br>thing's quite ridiculous.<br><br>I never thought anyone would<br>call you people in on this.<br><br>The local police called us.<br><br>As you know, sir, any crime,<br>however small, connected with<br><br>this establishment,<br>automatically comes through to us.<br><br>Quite possibly,<br><br>but this crime,<br><br>if you can call it that,<br><br>has nothing to do with<br>the establishment.<br><br>This tin can was stole from<br>Dr. Royston's own workshop,<br><br>it's purely a personal matter.<br><br>I should have thought<br>the local police<br><br>were well able to<br>take care of that.<br><br>As for the story of Dr. Royston's<br>about the tin containing some...<br><br>...radioactive material.<br>Well, I've spoke to the doctor about that,<br><br>and I don't want to hear anymore<br>about the matter, thank you.<br><br>Well, I do, sir.<br><br>So, perhaps you can tell me<br>where I can find Dr. Royston.<br><br>Obviously, Inspector...<br><br>...Mr. McGill...<br><br>If you place any credence in this<br>story, you don't<br><br>know the first thing about<br>the basic facts of science.<br><br>- Now, let me...<br>- Dr. Royston does.<br><br>- Does what?<br>- Know about the basic fact of science.<br><br>Look here, sir,<br>I've been sent up here to...<br><br>...pursue an investigation.<br><br>Perhaps you'll allow<br>me to do just that.<br><br>Where can I find Dr. Royston?<br><br>Don't you chaps even stop to eat?<br><br>My name's McGill,<br>do you mind if I sit down?<br><br>United Kingdom, Atomic Energy<br>Commission, Internal Security Police.<br><br>Sounds very impressive.<br><br>Impressive, yes, except on paydays.<br><br>- Well, Inspector, what can I possibly...<br>- Mister.<br><br>OK, Mac, what can I tell you?<br><br>It's about that child that was<br>burned, any idea how it happened?<br><br>Well, not for sure, no.<br><br>It's possible he may have handled<br>that sample container of mine.<br><br>Oh, the case of the missing radiation.<br>Yes, I've heard about that already.<br><br>- From the Director?<br>- From the Director.<br><br>There's no doubt as to his<br>opinions about the matter.<br><br>What about yours?<br>Oh, I'm not entitled to have any opinion.<br><br>I'm only interested in facts.<br><br>I was talking to that old<br>reprobate up in the tower, old Tom.<br><br>One fact I did manage<br>to learn was that child<br><br>never went near that<br>container of yours.<br><br>He was burned by something else.<br><br>Dr. Royston, I'd like you to<br>help me find out what it was.<br><br>I'm so sorry.<br><br>Oh, Willie.<br><br>I expect you'd like to stay here<br>awhile, use my room.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>The boy's parents.<br><br>Is he dead?<br><br>I'm afraid so,<br>he never regained consciousness<br><br>Adam, we've got to find out<br>how this thing happened!<br><br>- That's what we're trying to do, Doctor.<br>- Kelly. - McGill<br><br>That's why we came<br>to seek for it.<br><br>Dr. Royston, isn't it?<br><br>- Mr. Harding, how...<br>- There's nothing you can say will help.<br><br>I know about you, Dr. Royston!<br><br>You're a scientist, not a doctor.<br><br>You don't look after the sick<br><br>You meddle with things that kill,<br>like they killed my boy in here.<br><br>You should be locked up Royston.<br><br>Locked up with other like you.<br><br>Letting off bombs you can't control.<br><br>You're not safe.<br><br>You're a murderer.<br><br>Mr. Harding, please.<br><br>I don't know what to do.<br>I just don't know.<br><br>My wife!<br><br>I don't think he really<br>meant what he said, Adam.<br><br>Yes, he did, Mac.<br>He meant it.<br><br>I'm sure you know, that though it all,<br>we only try to create, not destroy.<br><br>Two minutes?<br>Right.<br><br>Zena, in here.<br><br>Hmm, cozy.<br><br>- Convenient too.<br>- So I've heard from the other nurses.<br><br>You don't want to take any<br>notice of what they tell you.<br><br>Oh, but I do,<br>that's why I'm here.<br><br>What did you think<br>I came down for?<br><br>A course of... radium treatment?<br><br>Zena, darling,<br>why didn't we start doing this earlier?<br><br>I've given you enough<br>encouragement, haven't I?<br><br>But you should've been more direct.<br><br>You should've come up and said...<br><br>Harry, I want... I want...<br><br>- What the?<br>- It switched on.<br><br>Must be your electric personality.<br><br>Stay here, don't move.<br><br>This is where we stored the radium.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Obviously, the radium was the target.<br><br>Safe proved no obstacle<br>whatsoever, did it?<br><br>What sort of heat would<br>be required to do this?<br><br>Heat far beyond anything<br>we ever dreamed of.<br><br>Don't forget the time element.<br><br>Whatever happened in here must've<br>taken place in a few seconds.<br><br>Perhaps we'll learn a bit more<br>when we can talk to the girl.<br><br>Look, there's another thing, Adam.<br><br>- I know, it's all over the place.<br>- Same as in your workshop.<br><br>Any luck?<br><br>I don't know if she'll recover,<br>but I think it would be a good<br><br>thing if we got here away from<br>here as quickly as possible.<br><br>You mean she won't be able<br>to tell us what happened?<br><br>She won't be able to<br>tell you her own name.<br><br>Royston?<br><br>What is this?<br>What are we dealing with?<br><br>How could anyone get in<br>here when there are people<br><br>outside there in the<br>corridor all the time?<br><br>Well, apparently,<br>this is the only place it could come in.<br><br>But, the grill doesn't open,<br>it's cemented to the wall.<br><br>- Came in through the grill.<br>- But, Adam, that's impossible.<br><br>Whatever it was that<br>did all this certainly<br><br>wasn't small enough<br>to come through that.<br><br>Well, how small is<br>10,000 gallons of oil?<br><br>What do you mean?<br><br>10,000 gallons of oil would take up<br>a pretty large area, wouldn't it?<br><br>And yet,<br>10,000 gallons of oil could come<br><br>through the holes in that<br>grill, couldn't it?<br><br>Yes, it could.<br><br>Then, that's the way it got into my<br>workshop, it came in under the door.<br><br>You know, obviously...<br><br>this thing can take up<br>any shape it needs to.<br><br>Where do you think it is now?<br><br>Somewhere out on the ridges.<br><br>Well, thank goodness<br>that Major didn't take my<br><br>advice and station a<br>couple soldiers out there.<br><br>But he did.<br><br>Brew up!<br><br>- What's that?<br>- Tea.<br><br>You don't hear something?<br><br>Like what?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Must have been...<br><br>No, it couldn't have been.<br><br>Hey, Spider,<br>there's a really great glow out here.<br><br>- What is it, Haggis?<br>- I'm not sure.<br><br>- You better go and have a look.<br>- Yeah.<br><br>- Why me?<br>- Frightened?<br><br>Yeah.... and I don't<br>mind admitting it either.<br><br>You know these parts better than<br>me, you go have a look.<br><br>I don't know these parts.<br><br>- You're a Scott, ain't ya?<br>- Aye, but I was born 300 miles from here.<br><br>Doesn't matter now,<br>anyhow, it's gone away.<br><br>Well, I suppose I'd<br>better go have a look.<br><br>- Keep my tea warm, Spider.<br>- OK.<br><br>Here, Haggis...<br><br>Haggis, I've been thinking...<br><br>Why don't you and me go<br>to Glasgow on our next 48?<br><br>You can show me the castle!<br><br>Hey, Spider, come here, quick!<br>Look!<br><br>Haggis?!<br><br>Haggis?!<br><br>What's the matter, Haggis?!<br><br>What is it, Haggis?<br><br>Haggis?!<br><br>Where are you, Haggis?<br><br>Haggis?<br><br>Guard?!<br><br>Guard!<br><br>Looks like we're too late.<br><br>I suggested this meeting<br>because I think I<br><br>have an idea of what<br>we may be dealing with.<br><br>Perhaps one of you<br>may have a solution.<br><br>Then again, perhaps one of<br>you may think I'm talking a<br><br>lot of nonsense and can offer<br>a more logical conclusion.<br><br>What's this going to be<br>then, Adam, fact or theory?<br><br>Partly fact, mostly theory.<br><br>I see, well, carry on,<br>we're all listening.<br><br>I'd like to resurrect for just a moment,<br>if I may, a treatise I did when I<br><br>was a student. Which has to do with<br>the cooling of the earth's Surface.<br><br>Hundred's of millions of years<br>ago, the earth was like the sun...<br><br>...no form, no solidity to it,<br>it was just a blazing mass of energy.<br><br>And then the Earth started cooling,<br>and as it cooled an outer crust was formed.<br><br>The energy was still there, but it was<br>being compressed beneath this crust.<br><br>As time went by, the crust grew deeper.<br><br>An the compression became<br>greater as this vast energy<br><br>was being squeezed into<br>an ever decreasing space.<br><br>May I interrupt a moment, Adam?<br>What you're telling us is<br><br>something every schoolboy knows.<br>What's it leading to?<br><br>I'm sorry, maybe I should<br>skip the preliminaries.<br><br>No, don't skip anything, Adam,<br>I was never very bright at school.<br><br>Well, then in a comparatively<br>short space of time,<br><br>a matter of a 100 thousand<br>years, man has evolved.<br><br>And man has evolved from<br>nothing, to becoming the most<br><br>intelligent creature on<br>the surface of this planet.<br><br>Now, considering the far<br>greater span of time involved...<br><br>...isn't it reasonable<br>to assume that the<br><br>forces contained in the<br>center of this earth...<br><br>...have developed an<br>intelligence of their own?<br><br>If we accept this, we must then<br>consider what these forces would think.<br><br>Their world is slowly being<br>compressed out of existence.<br><br>Therefore, survival must be<br>uppermost in their thoughts.<br><br>What's more natural in their<br>search for survival than that they<br><br>should return to the face of the<br>planet where once they lived.<br><br>Now...<br><br>...if you check, you will find every 50 years,<br>by virtue of the position of the Earth in the<br><br>solar system, a greater pull is exerted on the<br>surface of this planet than at other times.<br><br>Quite unnoticeable to us,<br>but 2,000 miles down, who knows?<br><br>And during the short period of<br>time that this pull is at it's most<br><br>powerful, you will also find there's<br>always been a freak earth tremor.<br><br>And that in each of these cases, a fissure<br>has opened in the surface of the Earth.<br><br>Now, what if, on these occasions,<br>some of the vast energy trapped below<br><br>had caused the eruptions or tremors<br>in an attempt to reach the surface?<br><br>What if, in fact,<br>it did reach the surface?<br><br>It looked around for a means<br>to sustain its existence.<br><br>For to live,<br>one must have nourishment.<br><br>And these forces are almost pure<br>energy, and what does energy live on?<br><br>- Energy.<br>- Exactly.<br><br>Energy can only be fed<br>with more energy... or...<br><br>...radiation, if you like.<br><br>50, 100, 150 years ago, these forces<br>found themselves without any means<br><br>of sustenance and their mass became<br>unstable and they disintegrated.<br><br>Now, we come to this 50 year cycle...<br><br>...this time, there's radiation!<br><br>There was radiation in the hospital.<br><br>There was radiation in my workshop!<br><br>As long as this thing feeds, it will live.<br><br>And the more it lives,<br>the more it will grow.<br><br>It's fantastic.<br><br>I admit, it does sound that<br>way, doesn't it?<br><br>But if anyone can offer a<br>simpler explanation of what's<br><br>been going on,<br>I'd be grateful and relived to hear it.<br><br>You're trying to tell us that some kind<br>of creature came up out of the fissure?<br><br>Mac, I'm not trying to tell you<br>anything, I'm just putting<br><br>forward a theory based on<br>the facts that we know.<br><br>- So, what do we look for?<br>- I don't know.<br><br>And what do we do if<br>we find something?<br><br>I'm afraid I don't know that either.<br><br>How big is this thing supposed to be?<br><br>Might be the size of my fist.<br><br>Might be as large as a house.<br><br>We can't stand about here, we've got<br>to find this thing, and destroy it.<br><br>Destroy it?<br><br>How are you going to do that,<br>shoot it, burn it, blow it up?<br><br>Listen to me, all of you!<br><br>We've been told a story based on a<br>little fact, and a great deal of fiction.<br><br>I'm amazed that this story<br>has been accepted by all<br><br>of you without the slightest<br>doubt or hesitation.<br><br>I said just now that I<br>thought the whole thing<br><br>was fantastic,<br>I'll go further than that...<br><br>...it's absolute rubbish!<br><br>Dr. Royston, you're a<br>scientist, you deal with facts.<br><br>A man of your intelligence and capabilities<br>has no right to talk as you have.<br><br>You astound me!<br><br>- What about that boy being burned?<br>- We've been all through that.<br><br>And that business<br>at the hospital?<br><br>There must be some perfectly<br>logical explanation for it,<br><br>I suggest we leave the police<br>to find out what it is.<br><br>I'm the police, in a way, and I've<br>come here to get Dr. Royston's advice.<br><br>In that case,<br>I'll waste no more time.<br><br>Good night, gentlemen.<br><br>I'm sorry if anybody<br>else feels that way.<br><br>Let's try and get a<br>look at this thing.<br><br>The only way we can do<br>that is go to the fissure.<br><br>But we've been there<br>more than once already.<br><br>We've seen nothing.<br><br>You misunderstood me. Somebody<br>has got to go down in the fissure.<br><br>Well, all ready, sir.<br><br>Peter, now, you're quite sure you<br>still want to go through with this?<br><br>I know, we've argued this out before.<br><br>After all,<br>I did volunteer for the job.<br><br>- He's right, Adam.<br>- OK, Peter.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>- Senior doesn't like it at all.<br>- Ha ha, nor do any of us.<br><br>Director of the establishment’s<br>been on to him,<br><br>told him he thinks the whole<br>things a waste of time.<br><br>I hope you're not in any<br>trouble, Major.<br><br>Not yet,<br>but I have strict orders what to do.<br><br>All ready. Sir.<br><br>- You're all right now, are you?<br>- Yes, sure.<br><br>What's the drill?<br><br>If there's any radioactivity<br>on that Geiger counter,<br><br>let us know and we'll<br>get you out of there.<br><br>Right, lower it away.<br><br>Keep going.<br><br>Lower.<br><br>Lower away.<br><br>Keep going,<br><br>Lower.<br><br>You all right, sir?<br><br>Nothing to report, sir.<br><br>Lower.<br><br>Oop.<br><br>- Oop, stop, stop there!<br>- Hold it!<br><br>All right, lower away again.<br><br>Stop lowering!<br><br>You all right, sir?<br><br>He's all right.<br><br>What is it?<br><br>He's all right,<br>but something's happening, sir.<br><br>No, it's all right, keep lowering.<br><br>Keep lowering!<br><br>Stop! Stop lowering!<br><br>Get me out of here, quick!<br><br>Faster! Faster!<br><br>Faster! Fast as you can!<br>Come on now!<br><br>Bring him up, boys.<br><br>Come on, boys!<br><br>Faster! Heave! Faster!<br><br>Crank faster!<br><br>You were right, sir.<br><br>There's a body of a<br>soldier down there.<br><br>- It's all burnt up.<br>- What else?<br><br>Well, never mind about that,<br>let's get away from here.<br><br>Peter,<br>what did you see down there?<br><br>I don't know what it was,<br><br>it was like something out of a<br>nightmare, it was horrible.<br><br>We'll talk about that later,<br>and you get in the car, Peter.<br><br>I told you I had my orders, sir.<br><br>They were to take action if<br>anything was found down there.<br><br>What sort of action?<br><br>Kill whatever it is,<br>and concrete the whole thing over.<br><br>Concrete it over?<br><br>- You don't mean that?<br>- Those are my orders.<br><br>Well, Major, when do you start?<br><br>Tonight, right away.<br><br>- Sergeant?<br>- Right, sir!<br><br>Well, you seem to be<br>making a job of it.<br><br>I think this should do the trick.<br>What about you?<br><br>You know this Royston chap,<br>brilliant of course, I'm sure.<br><br>But the trouble with some<br>of these scientific types<br><br>is they can't see the<br>easy way out of anything.<br><br>It's got to be complicated<br>if it's going to work.<br><br>Come in, come in.<br><br>Hello, Mac.<br><br>Where you been all day?<br>Here, hold this.<br><br>- Down at the fissure.<br>- Oh, they finished down there?<br><br>- What did they do, exactly?<br>- Practically everything.<br><br>Flame throwers, high explosive,<br>and a neat little concrete tombstone.<br><br>Rest in peace, huh?<br><br>You don't think it's done any<br>good, do you?<br><br>Well, how could it?<br>Let's look at the facts, you know this...<br><br>Here, give me that.<br><br>There's this \"X\", this unknown<br>quantity, whatever it is, has<br><br>forced it's way through miles<br>and miles of solid rock.<br><br>How's a couple feet of<br>concrete going to stop it?<br><br>But what about the<br>flamethrowers and explosive?<br><br>Nothing could live after that!<br><br>Perhaps nothing we've ever<br>encountered before, but...<br><br>...no, this isn't a living<br>organism, as we know it.<br><br>It's life source may be<br>the same as we've got here.<br><br>Stay on the side of the screen.<br><br>That's good.<br><br>Now, Mac, how would you<br>go about killing that?<br><br>What is it?<br><br>It's a particle of mud.<br><br>And by virtue of it's atomic<br>structure, emits radiation.<br><br>That's all it is, just mud.<br>How do you kill mud?<br><br>Have you informed anyone<br>in London about all this?<br><br>Hmm, no more than a half a dozen times.<br><br>And?<br><br>Well, at first they were<br>interested, but skeptical.<br><br>They suggested I get in touch<br>with the Director about it.<br><br>And later on,<br>the Director got in touch with them.<br><br>The result is,<br>I've been called back to London.<br><br>- When?<br>- Tonight.<br><br>I'm catching the last<br>plane from Glasgow.<br><br>Mac, I'm sorry to hear that.<br><br>You've become one of<br>my staunchest allies.<br><br>Adam, this thing is going to<br>break out again, isn't it?<br><br>In my opinion, yes.<br><br>Isn't there anything<br>we can do to stop it?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Something I've been working<br>on a long time now. A method of...<br><br>...disintegrating atomic structure,<br>obviating with the sudden explosion.<br><br>Well, it's...<br><br>Look, what's an atomic bomb?<br><br>It's a breaking up of atomic<br>particles, isn't it?<br><br>Well, not quite, but that's close enough.<br>You see, I'm<br><br>trying to achieve this breaking<br>up, without the explosion.<br><br>This is a...<br><br>Look, I'll show you.<br><br>Now, in that lead container is<br>an atomically unstable compound.<br><br>Two things can happen to it...<br><br>Either it will continue to give off radiation<br>for the next 200 years, or it can be<br><br>subjected to an outside force which will<br>disintegrate it in a fraction of a second.<br><br>- A bomb, in fact.<br>- Well, if you like, yes.<br><br>But see,<br>that's what I'm trying to prevent.<br><br>Now, theoretically...<br><br>...if you draw this stuff<br>between the scanners...<br><br>...and adjust the scanners<br>to a certain pitch,<br><br>a neutralizing affect<br>should be achieved.<br><br>You mean to say that this apparatus<br>would neutralize an atomic bomb?<br><br>- So that it wouldn't explode?<br>- That's my point, it couldn't.<br><br>It couldn't, it wouldn't<br>be a bomb anymore, it would<br><br>just be a handful of mud<br>and a very expensive casing.<br><br>But, Adam, that's fantastic!<br><br>A step in the right direction<br>anyway, isn't it, Mac?<br><br>Will you be able to use this<br>against that thing out there?<br><br>Six months time, perhaps, but...<br><br>Yes, Russell, what is it?<br><br>Mr. Peters sent me down to<br>remind you of the time, sir.<br><br>Oh... yes, yes, thank you.<br><br>Oh, Russell, you were able to<br>locate Mr. Elliott, weren't you?<br><br>- Not yet, no sir.<br>- Oh, that's too bad.<br><br>All right, thank you,<br>I'll be right out.<br><br>We're taking the cobalt<br>out of the pile tonight,<br><br>and we haven't been<br>able to locate John yet.<br><br>Well, Mac, we're sure going<br>to miss you around here.<br><br>Goodbye, Adam. Good luck.<br><br>- Peter, is that truck ready?<br>- Yes, it's standing by outside, sir.<br><br>Well, as soon as these are all<br>out, I want you to<br><br>get a quick reading,<br>and then we'll load them.<br><br>The pile is now inactive!<br><br>The pile is now inactive!<br><br>OK, boys, let's get started<br>and I'll get these out.<br><br>No, sir, I don't. I think we have<br>every chance of seeing it again.<br><br>Excuse me...<br><br>I'm sorry, sir, the lines bad.<br><br>Yes, I see.<br>But I only want one more night, sir.<br><br>If nothing happens, I can catch<br>the first plane tomorrow morning.<br><br>Station Sergeant speaking.<br><br>Yes, of course. Aye.<br><br>Aye.<br><br>Where?<br><br>Well, thank you, sir.<br><br>Oh, there's one other thing.<br>I believe the Director,<br><br>Mr. Elliott's got in touch<br>with you earlier today.<br><br>You must speak up,<br>this phone's bad!<br><br>- Oh, yes, I've seen him.<br>- I've got that.<br><br>What about the occupants?<br><br>They what?<br>You must be mad!<br><br>No sir, he doesn't, I<br>know, but all the same.<br><br>All right, sir.<br><br>Very well, good night.<br><br>All right,<br>I'll send somebody out right away!<br><br>Williams, I want you to go<br>out, there's been an accident!<br><br>Right, Sarge.<br><br>- Thank you, Sergeant.<br>- Right, sir<br><br>And tell McGowan to report to<br>me when he comes off duty.<br><br>People melting, indeed.<br><br>- What's that you say?<br>- Oh, there's been an accident, sir.<br><br>Four miles from here.<br><br>Yes, I know, I heard that,<br>but what's this about people melting?<br><br>Well, that's what the man on the beat<br>said, I think he must be...<br><br>Let me have that address.<br>Thank you.<br><br>Hey, what do you<br>think you're doing?<br><br>Do you hear me?<br><br>I say,<br>what do you think you're doing?<br><br>Sorry, sir.<br><br>Where's the nearest telephone?<br><br>The nearest public phone is<br>a couple of miles away, sir.<br><br>But maybe one of these people<br>will let you use theirs.<br><br>Anybody live near<br>here have a phone?<br><br>Aye, there's a phone in my shop, half<br>a mile down the road. You can use that.<br><br>Thanks very much.<br>Pop in the car, I'll drive you down.<br><br>Dr. Royston?<br><br>John, we've just taken the<br>cobalt out of the pile.<br><br>- There wasn't time...<br>- On who's authority?<br><br>Well, there wasn't really<br>time to check with you.<br><br>You know how long it takes to<br>get that pile started again.<br><br>You'll put the cobalt bombardment<br>weeks behind schedule.<br><br>Entirely on you own initiative,<br>you break in on an official experiment.<br><br>You deactivate the pile<br>without consulting me.<br><br>This isn't your<br>workshop, Royston!<br><br>This is a government establishment,<br>and I'm it's director.<br><br>Look, I'm sorry,<br>you'll have to speak louder.<br><br>No, he's busy right now,<br>this is Peter Elliott.<br><br>Oh yes.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>I'll tell him, right away.<br><br>Dr. Royston, it's McGill.<br><br>It appears what you were<br>afraid of has happened.<br><br>It's just killed 4 people in a car.<br><br>The lines terrible,<br>but I think he said they'd melted.<br><br>Hello, Mac, this is Royston.<br><br>What's this all about?<br><br>Yes, yes, wait a minute.<br><br>Just a minute.<br><br>Do you have a pencil, please?<br><br>Go ahead.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Where?<br><br>Yes, right... right.<br><br>Got it.<br><br>Do you have a local<br>surveying map in your office?<br><br>Yes, there's one up there.<br><br>- Let's take a look at it.<br>- Yes, of course, come on.<br><br>This point right<br>here is the fissure.<br><br>Now, here is the hospital.<br><br>This is where something<br>was seen glowing.<br><br>Now, over here, is my workshop.<br><br>If we follow this line,<br>right here is the old tower.<br><br>You know, this thing can<br>obviously sense radioactivity.<br><br>And once it does, nothing can stop it.<br>Makes straight for the radiation.<br><br>And then returns to the fissure.<br><br>And by these lines, it's pretty<br>clear it returns by the same route.<br><br>Now, this latest report,<br>this burned out car, is right here.<br><br>Now, if we extend the line from<br>the fissure through this point,<br><br>somewhere along this extended<br>line is where it's headed.<br><br>- I see.<br>- Here!<br><br>That's right, it's on its way for<br>the biggest meal of it's life!<br><br>Hurry up, man, hurry<br>up, open the gate!<br><br>- All right, all right.<br>- Oh, come along, man, open up the gate.<br><br>- Let's see your pass.<br>- Oh, you know me.<br><br>- Come along, open up!<br>- Sorry, sir, let's see your pass first.<br><br>- Here.<br>- All right, sir.<br><br>We daren't put that cobalt back in the<br>pile, we've got to get it out of here fast.<br><br>There must be a limit to the<br>distance it can sense radiation.<br><br>We've got to get<br>beyond that point.<br><br>Adam,<br>I just wanted to say that...<br><br>Oh, never mind.<br>I'll go and warn the security people.<br><br>- Mac.<br>- Adam.<br><br>- Any sign of it yet?<br>- No, not yet.<br><br>It can't be far off.<br><br>I've warned everybody to keep indoors.<br>Upstairs, if possible.<br><br>I posted every man I could lay<br>hands on to keep watch for it.<br><br>I tried to phone London again, but there's<br>something the matter with the lines.<br><br>It's all interference.<br><br>We've got the same trouble here.<br><br>- Nobody's spotted a thing, huh?<br>- None of my men have seen anything.<br><br>I'd like to know why?<br>A thing that big simply can't disappear.<br><br>No, but it might alter it's form<br>and become almost invisible.<br><br>Isn't that true?<br><br>What's going on here?<br><br>We're trying to get this<br>cobalt loaded and out of here.<br><br>What about the gates<br>around this place?<br><br>They're being watched.<br><br>I'd like to phone around the<br>gates, if I may?<br><br>There's a phone in there.<br><br>The line isn't very good, I'm afraid.<br><br>Peter!<br><br>Check the main gate.<br>See if you can spot it.<br><br>Clear this yard, boys!<br><br>- Adam, what about the cobalt?<br>- There's nothing we can do about that now.<br><br>But if it gets near, it might explode it.<br><br>Then we'll be the first to explode a<br>cobalt bomb, now clear out of here!<br><br>Boys, get out of this yard!<br>Come on!<br><br>Hello! Wait a minute!<br><br>It's the main yard gate.<br>Where can we see it from?<br><br>Up that ladder, sir!<br><br>Tell everyone to stay clear of the<br>west approach to the reactor building.<br><br>It's coming in that way.<br><br>Our only chance is the hope<br>that it absorbs radiation.<br><br>Won't that make it unstable<br>as the cobalt decays?<br><br>Yes, yes it would.<br><br>Dr. Royston...<br><br>...its on its way.<br><br>The man on the main gate<br>had it just like the others.<br><br>It's coming in on the west side.<br><br>Look! There it is on the roof!<br><br>Up there, quick!<br><br>It's growing larger.<br><br>The mass has to increase to<br>accommodate the extra radiation.<br><br>How big will it get?<br><br>The important thing is how<br>unstable is it going to get?<br><br>Isn't there anything we can do?<br><br>Well, we can try, but not here.<br><br>The only thing we can do is to<br>let it go back to the fissure.<br><br>Now we know the exact<br>route it will take so let's<br><br>clear that route and get<br>everybody out of its path.<br><br>I'll see if the army has a helicopter.<br>We can use that<br><br>to keep a check on it,<br>in case it changes direction.<br><br>What are you going to do, Adam?<br><br>- I'm going down to my workshop.<br>- It's moving.<br><br>Any luck?<br><br>I can't hear a thing,<br>the static's drowning out everything.<br><br>The sergeant says that's a sure<br>sign the thing's not far off.<br><br>- Aye, let's get back to Lock Mouth.<br>- Aye.<br><br>Come on now, hurry!<br>You'll be safe inside the chapel.<br><br>Come on now.<br>Inside, hurry!<br><br>- Do you need any help, minister?<br>- I don't think so.<br><br>How near is it going to come?<br><br>It should pass within a 100<br>yards of where you are now.<br><br>Between those trees.<br><br>- How much longer.<br>- About 2 minutes, as far as I can tell.<br><br>Come on, Mrs. McGinty,<br>let me take your bundle.<br><br>Come on, it's nice and warm inside.<br><br>There you are.<br><br>It's changed direction,<br>it's not following the same route.<br><br>Plot a map the other way out.<br><br>That was close.<br><br>Army copter to mobile, heading out<br>from Loch Mouth, traveling east.<br><br>Oh, what's the use, they'll never<br>hear anything in this static.<br><br>- Are you getting all this, lad?<br>- Oh, yes, sir.<br><br>Oh, fine, let's get over to Check Point 3.<br><br>Just... there.<br><br>Come on, ladies, hurry,<br>there is no time to lose, hurry!<br><br>Inside, quickly!<br><br>Wait here.<br><br>Every line out of this place is useless.<br>Radio's even worse.<br><br>There's no hope of getting<br>through to London now.<br><br>We've got to handle this ourselves.<br><br>I still think that as soon as it gets to<br>the fissure, we ought to leave it alone.<br><br>That is, until we can get<br>in touch with the ministry.<br><br>Look, Mr. Elliott,<br>Adam says the larger this<br><br>thing grows,<br>the more its range will increase.<br><br>You know the next<br>point it will make for?<br><br>There, that's it, the experimental<br>nuclear power station at Glen Cardiff.<br><br>And to reach there, it will go right<br>through the center of Inverness.<br><br>Now do you see, we've got to<br>stop this thing at the fissure.<br><br>And we've got to stop it for good.<br><br>- Well, Adam?<br>- How's it going?<br><br>Not too good,<br>I'm just ready to try again.<br><br>Watch out now, just in case.<br><br>- That's it, it's worked.<br>- You've done it, Adam, you've done it!<br><br>Adam, look!<br><br>The container, it's glowing!<br><br>What's happening, sir?<br><br>Well, that won't do,<br>we'll have to try again.<br><br>There's no time to try again!<br><br>If a piece of material no bigger<br>than a pin head can cause an<br><br>explosion like that can't you<br>imagine what would happen out there?<br><br>We've got to have time!<br><br>I don't care, Adam,<br>we've got to take the chance!<br><br>We've got to try and stop<br>this thing at the fissure!<br><br>Dr. Royston?<br><br>Those scanners, they could have<br>slipped out of synchronization.<br><br>They might have, yes.<br><br>Might have been a<br>hundred other things.<br><br>But could it have been the<br>scanners, Adam?<br><br>Yes, yes, they...<br><br>...being out of sync<br>might have caused it.<br><br>Everything you've asked for<br>is at the fissure, Adam.<br><br>Trucks, radioactive material...<br>everything's ready!<br><br>Well, if that's the way it's got to<br>be, let's get started.<br><br>Tell them to get that<br>copter away from here.<br><br>Noise enough to wake the dead,<br>let alone that thing down there.<br><br>Right, sir.<br><br>- Is everything here, Major?<br>- I don't know yet.<br><br>What are all these men doing?<br><br>Mac, let's clear this area.<br><br>Well, if anything goes wrong,<br>it won't matter much where they are.<br><br>True, but they'll get in our way.<br>Now, is this our Jeep?<br><br>That's it, just as you ordered.<br><br>You know what you got on the<br>back there is bait, don't you?<br><br>Yes, sir.<br><br>The purpose is to entice<br>whatever is down there, out.<br><br>Now don't you get any closer than 15<br>feet, you understand that?<br><br>Very good, sir.<br><br>Let's get started.<br><br>- Have the trucks follow.<br>- Right.<br><br>- Mr. Thomson, follow this car down.<br>- Right, sir.<br><br>Now, Peter, don't let that Jeep<br>get any closer than 15 feet.<br><br>- Remember that, 15 feet.<br>- Right, sir!<br><br>Can we do anything to help, Adam?<br><br>No, Mac, just keep your fingers crossed.<br><br>Right, well,<br>we'll stay out of your way, anyhow.<br><br>Major, impress upon your men the importance<br>of keeping these scanners in phase.<br><br>As soon as we're ready,<br>I'll give the signal for the switch on.<br><br>Right.<br><br>Everything all right?<br><br>Thank you, sir.<br>I've got the cobalt out.<br><br>- I'll get the men under cover, sir.<br>- What's that? Yes, yes!<br><br>Hold it, you lads, take cover.<br><br>Come along all of you,<br>get your heads down behind this bank here.<br><br>Come on, Dole, what are you waiting for?<br><br>What's going to happen, Sarge?<br><br>I'm gonna kick you head in if you don't<br>get it down, that's what's gonna happen.<br><br>Give me the OK as soon as<br>you're synchronized. - Right!<br><br>- You ready number one?<br>- Ready, sir!<br><br>Are you ready number two?<br><br>Ready, sir!<br><br>Excuse me, Major.<br><br>Peter!<br>Turn on the Jeep.<br><br>Bring out the Jeep!<br><br>Hey, what's the matter?<br><br>Right, come on, get<br>out, I'll take it.<br><br>Good luck, sir!<br><br>You better take cover too.<br><br>It's Peter.<br><br>- What do you think you're doing?<br>- The drivers sick.<br><br>That's no reason why<br>you should do it.<br><br>What's he doing?<br><br>Peter!<br><br>Peter, don't go any closer!<br><br>Peter, don't go any closer!<br>Peter!<br><br>Peter! Peter, don't be a fool!<br>Get back! Get back!<br><br>Peter!<br><br>Peter, get out, Peter!<br><br>Get out, and try to walk!<br><br>All right!<br><br>Switch on!<br><br>- Switch on!<br>- Right, sir!<br><br>Switch on!<br><br>It's gone.<br><br>Adam, it's gone!<br><br>It worked, Mac, didn't it?<br><br>Bring out the Geigers!<br>Let's have a reading!<br><br>What was that?<br><br>I don't know,<br>but it shouldn't have happened.<br><br>But the thing's gone!<br><br>You should be very proud, Adam.<br>Your theories worked!<br><br>It has, Adam.<br><br></div>"], "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/X_the_Unknown-49967"},

Professor Xavier, Wolverine, Magneto, Storm, Kitty Pryde and her friends meet at a monastery in China and Xavier explains that the invincible Sentinels were created using the DNA of Mystique that was captured in 1973 when she tried to assassinate their creator Dr. Bolivar Trask. Xavier tells that their only chance is return to 1973 using Pryde's ability to join Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr to convince Mystique to give up of her intention. .

Apocalypse, the first and most powerful mutant from Marvel's X-Men universe, amassed the powers of many other mutants, becoming immortal and invincible.

it?<br><br>But I definitely don't have<br>a good feeling about this.<br><br>There it is again.<br><br>What is that?<br><br>I have no idea what that is.<br><br>It's really creepin' me<br>out babe, go

problems.<br><br>What are you talking about?<br><br>I must bring this<br>into the world.<br><br>It is a gift for everyone.<br><br>How do you know that?<br><br>They told me.<br><br>Who's \"they,\" Harry?<br><br>You'll see.<br><br>Jimmy, Daisy, no, leave it.<br><br>No, oh my god, no!<br><br>Jimmy?<br><br>Daisy?<br><br>Jimmy?<br><br>Daisy?<br><br>Come on,

what's happening right<br>now, I saw what happened.<br><br>- What are you talking about?<br>- The crystal, your husband.<br><br>- The visions.<br>- How do you know about that?<br><br>We can't let it happen,<br>it's got to be stopped.<br><br>Stop what?<br><br>We can't let him take<br><br>the crystal into the<br>city full of people.<br><br>Think of what will happen.<br><br>They don't want to<br>save the planet,<br><br>they want to sterilize<br>the entire planet.<br><br>I have seen the visions.<br><br>What are we supposed to<br>do, get rid of the crystal?<br><br>The crystal can't be destroyed.<br><br>All we can do is<br>hide it for now.<br><br>But they always seem to find<br>it and find another way.<br><br>How do you know that?<br><br>The same thing happened to<br>my wife and many others.<br><br>I've seen it happen<br>several times.<br><br>What are we supposed to do?<br><br>We've got to get the<br>crystal from him.<br><br>We gotta get it back.<br><br>How?<br><br>Every time I grab<br>it, I get burned.<br><br>We have to do something or<br>else this is what will happen.<br><br>How did they die?<br><br>All of them victims, my<br>wife is buried there too.<br><br>She went mad when she found the<br>crystal, she killed herself.<br><br>I buried her here to<br>hide her and the crystal,<br><br>hoping no one would ever<br>have to suffer the same fate.<br><br>Your husband can't take<br><br>the crystal into the<br>city, he just can't.<br><br>We better hurry because<br>he can't get very far.<br><br>I've got the keys.<br><br>You need to go in<br>and distract him.<br><br>I'll see if we can take<br>the crystal from him.<br><br>Okay, I'll talk to him.<br><br>Harry?<br><br>What are you looking for, babe?<br><br>The keys, okay?<br><br>I need the car keys, we<br>gotta get outta here.<br><br>I don't know, why?<br><br>We gotta go back<br>to town, all right?<br><br>I'll explain later but<br>where are the damn keys?<br><br>- Babe, what's going on?<br>- Stop yelling at me please.<br><br>It hurts, where's the keys?<br><br>- Baby please.<br>- Oh my god.<br><br>We gotta get outta here, please!<br><br>I didn't mean<br>for you to hurt him.<br><br>Don't be fooled, he's<br>not your husband anymore.<br><br>He's not trying to<br>get to a hospital,<br><br>he's trying to get to the city.<br><br>Wait, don't do it.<br><br>You remember the last<br>time you did that?<br><br>I have to try.<br><br>Stop!<br><br>Harry, stop!<br><br>Stop, Harry stop!<br><br>Please stop.<br><br>Stop.<br><br>Please...<br><br>let me go home.<br><br>Please.<br><br>Don't you have any compassion?<br><br>Let me go.<br><br>Let us go.<br><br>Where's my husband?<br><br>He's gone already, I<br>tried my best to stop him.<br><br>What can I do?<br><br>- Nobody's gonna believe me.<br>- You have to keep going.<br><br>All right, come on.<br><br>Oh, my arms are broken.<br><br>If you wanna have a<br>chance, just leave me.<br><br>Harry, wait!<br><br>Hey lady.<br><br>Help me.<br><br>So how did<br>you get so far out here?<br><br>My husband's hurt, I'm<br>trying to find him.<br><br>Look, I don't know what<br>you're talking about<br><br>with all that but let me get<br>you to the hospital, okay?<br><br>Wait stop stop stop, that's him.<br><br>Let me out, let me out.<br><br>Are you sure you wanna do this?<br><br>Isn't that the guy who hurt you?<br><br>Harry.<br><br>Harry, wait.<br><br>May I get a ride into the city?<br><br>Hop in.<br><br>To this day, I know they<br>implanted something in my tooth.<br><br>I can hear them every day.<br><br>Do you hear them right now?<br><br>No.<br><br>They talk to me when I'm alone<br><br>or when I'm with a non-believer.<br><br>They wanna make you look crazy.<br><br>They implanted<br>something in my head too<br><br>except I hear these<br>high pitched sounds<br><br>and somehow I can<br>understand them but<br><br>they only communicate<br>with me when I'm sleeping,<br><br>in my dreams.<br><br>Thank you for your honesty<br><br>and most importantly,<br>your courage.<br><br>Pardon me, everyone.<br><br>I'm sorry to bother you.<br><br>Is this the alien<br>abduction group?<br><br>- How can I help you?<br>- My daughter, she's missing.<br><br>I found out about you<br>and I need your help.<br><br>If she's missing, why don't<br><br>you just go to<br>the police, ma'am?<br><br>No, you don't understand,<br>I think she was abducted.<br><br>I think you should let her in,<br><br>I think she's telling the truth.<br><br>I don't think this<br>is a good idea.<br><br>- They could've followed her.<br>- I think Matt's right.<br><br>How do we know she's<br>not one of them?<br><br>Because look at her,<br>she's terrified.<br><br>I do not like this idea,<br>she could be one of them.<br><br>I really think she needs to<br>go, they could've followed her.<br><br>Matt, that's enough.<br><br>- Come on in.<br>- Thank you.<br><br>I know you don't know who I<br>am but I'm telling the truth.<br><br>My daughter was babysitting<br>while she was away at college.<br><br>- Where is she now?<br>- I don't know.<br><br>The last I heard from her,<br>she left me this message.<br><br>Mom, I<br>hope you get this.<br><br>Hi

kill me.<br><br>Shut up.<br><br>I wasn't talking to you,<br>I was talking to my girls.<br><br>You're all mentally deranged.<br><br>- I can't stomach your face.<br>- You need to understand.<br><br>Something's there in<br>the next room waiting.<br><br>My daddy was a monster and<br>you know what he would do?<br><br>He would put me in<br>the corner of a room<br><br>and he would beat me with<br>anything he could find.<br><br>So don't you dare<br><br>tell me what a monster is.<br><br>Cindy, will you go and<br>make us some tea please?<br><br>Would you like some tea?<br><br>I was just thinking, as I was<br>getting my ass kicked in,<br><br>I could certainly go for some<br>Royal English breakfast tea.<br><br>You're so disrespectful.<br><br>Melanie, enough.<br><br>Go check on Kara,<br>see if she's hungry.<br><br>Is that her name, Kara?<br><br>Cindy, the English breakfast<br>tea will be just fine.<br><br>Can you also bring me a<br>first aid kit, please?<br><br>I don't want-- what<br>is your name again?<br><br>- It's Edgar Price.<br>- Edgar.<br><br>I don't want Edgar bleeding<br>all over my floors.<br><br>Well Edgar, my name is Adrian,<br>you do know where you are?<br><br>I just need to finish<br>what I set out to do.<br><br>And what is that?<br><br>I need to kill the last of<br>'em before the next phase.<br><br>I'm sorry, I'm<br>not following you.<br><br>Look, you people<br>are in grave danger<br><br>as long as that thing<br>is under this roof.<br><br>Are you referring<br>to your wife, Kara?<br><br>- She's not a thing.<br>- That's not my wife.<br><br>You can't take out all<br>your anger on women.<br><br>Women are special.<br><br>Men are too.<br><br>I named this house<br>when I opened it<br><br>the Sullivan House<br>after Anne Sullivan.<br><br>You people are man-bashers<br>that hide behind a cause?<br><br>Don't you know what's about<br>to go down here, Adrian?<br><br>I will not be a victim no more.<br><br>Lady, if we don't get outta here<br><br>in about 45 minutes,<br>we're all gonna be dead.<br><br>That's how long a phase takes.<br><br>Cindy was forced to get<br>high with her father<br><br>and then violently<br>used as a punching bag.<br><br>She's been in our<br>program for 90 days.<br><br>Well I'm thinking they<br>all had a relapse.<br><br>It's called anger.<br><br>Sometimes you see something<br>and it triggers a memory,<br><br>no matter how much a<br>person has changed.<br><br>So yeah, I guess you<br>could say we had a relapse,<br><br>but when we see somebody<br>beating their wife,<br><br>nearly killing them, we lose<br>our shit, then we strike.<br><br>I guess you have<br>a story as well.<br><br>How do you take your tea, Edgar?<br><br>Lady, enough with the games,<br>tea time is over, untie me.<br><br>I was seven<br><br>when my mother died.<br><br>That's when my father<br>turned to alcohol.<br><br>He used to lock me in closets<br>every time I pissed him off.<br><br>That's when I ended<br>up in a shelter<br><br>and I read The Miracle Worker,<br>and that changed my life.<br><br>It made me want to help.<br><br>So I wanted to open up a<br>place for battered women.<br><br>You save lives, that's<br>very noble of you.<br><br>Well let me tell you what's<br>about to go down here.<br><br>Kara, she'll be coming out<br>to conclude the last phase<br><br>at the Sullivan House if<br>you don't untie me now!<br><br>What type of work<br>do you do, Edgar?<br><br>What?<br><br>She asked what type<br>of work do you do?<br><br>- I work for the government.<br>- Doing?<br><br>- I work for the government--<br>- Is your job stressful?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>What exactly do you<br>do for the government?<br><br>I work for a group that monitors<br><br>extraterrestrial<br>life here on earth.<br><br>What?<br><br>Like E.T.?<br><br>Lady, you wish they<br>all look like E.T.<br><br>They are ruthless,<br><br>they walk amongst us<br>imitating what we do.<br><br>All they need is<br>some sort of DNA from<br><br>that person and then<br>they multiply and feast.<br><br>When that happens, they call us.<br><br>We are highly trained to<br>seek out and destroy, period!<br><br>No matter what or who<br>they transform into,<br><br>you cannot look at<br>them as human, period!<br><br>She's an alien, your<br>wife's an alien?<br><br>She ate my wife.<br><br>What they eat, they become.<br><br>That's when they<br>can be put down.<br><br>During their transformational<br>stage, they're vulnerable.<br><br>Their personal protection<br>field is shut down.<br><br>They are here to,<br><br>where's that other girl<br>Melanie, where'd she go?<br><br>- Oh chill out--<br>- Checking on E.T.<br><br>She's been with her<br>too long, call her.<br><br>She's probably<br>trying to phone home.<br><br>Call her.<br><br>Chill out, enough with this.<br><br>Melanie?<br><br>- Melanie?<br>- Untie me now!<br><br>Mel.<br><br>She's done.<br><br>Yes?<br><br>- Everything okay?<br>- Yes.<br><br>Douchebag here thought<br><br>you were kidnapped by aliens.<br><br>She is not okay.<br><br>You were watching<br>her ass, right?<br><br>- What?<br>- I saw you.<br><br>Melanie is done, you

We don't want the\ncolonel to be late.\n<br>Comrade.\n<br>Missiles in Turkey\nsend a very clear message.\n<br>If we ever decide to fire them,\n<br>the Russian early-warning system\n<br>won't even have time to kick in.\n<br>This better be\nimportant, mactaggert.\n<br>Whoa, slow down.\n<br>Are you smoking them funny cigarettes?\nPeople don't disappear.\n<br>Colonel hendry was there.\n<br>He was there, mccone,\nin the hellfire club.\n<br>Colonel hendry?\n<br>I agree with you, general.\n<br>I've reconsidered my position\n<br>and I now believe we should put\nJupiter missiles in Turkey.\n<br>Colonel hendry is here.\n<br>So unless he magically traveled\n3,000 Miles in the last 10 minutes,\n<br>listen to me, I suggest that\nyou stop wasting my time.\n<br>Looks like hendry wants\nto start world war III.\n<br>I got bigger things to deal\nwith right now, mactaggert.\n<br>Sir, I...\n<br>God!\nHave you lost your mind?\n<br>So, now what?\n<br>We find an expert on\ngenetic mutation.\n<br>PR ofessor of genetics,\nCharles Francis Xavier.\n<br>So, how does it feel\nto be a Professor?\n<br>Don't call me that. You don't\nget to be called a Professor\n<br>until you actually have\na teaching position.\n<br>I know, but it suits you.\n<br>Don't say that. Do say,\n\"let's go have a drink.\"\n<br>Let's go have a drink.\nWonderful.\n<br>Afternoon, gentlemen.\n<br>Hot out there.\n<br>Beer, please.\n<br>German beer.\nOf course.\n<br>Yes, it's bitburger.\nYou like it?\n<br>The best.\n<br>What brings you to Argentina?\n<br>The climate.\nI'm a pig farmer.\n<br>Tailor.\nSince I was a boy.\n<br>My father made the finest\nsuits in Dusseldorf.\n<br>My parents were from Dusseldorf.\n<br>Ah.\n<br>What was their name?\n<br>They didn't have a name.\n<br>It was taken away from them...\n<br>By pig farmers...\n<br>And tailors.\n<br>Blood and honor.\n<br>Which would you\ncare to shed first?\n<br>We were under orders...\n<br>Blood then.\n<br>Freeze, asshole.\n<br>Come on, shoot.\n<br>Who... what are you?\n<br>Let's just say I'm\nFrankenstein's monster.\n<br>And I'm looking for my creator.\n<br>Drink! Drink! Drink!\n<br>Yeah!\n<br>I'm so proud of you. Thank you.\n<br>I need another drink. And\nyou need another cola.\n<br>Congratulations, Professor.\nThank you very much.\n<br>It's much harder than\nit looks, actually.\n<br>No, on your presentation.\n<br>You were at my presentation? How\nnice of you. Thank you very much.\n<br>Moira mactaggert.\n<br>Charles Xavier. Do\nyou have a minute?\n<br>For a pretty little bean\nwith a mutated mcrl gene?\n<br>I have five.\n<br>I say \"MCRL,\" you would\nsay \"AUBURN HAIR.\"\n<br>It's a mutation.\n<br>It's a very groovy mutation.\n<br>Mutation, right,\n<br>took us from single-celled\norganisms to the dominant form...\n<br>You know what? This routine may\ngo over great with the co-eds,\n<br>but I'm here on business.\n<br>What?\n<br>I really need your help.\n<br>All right.\n<br>The kind of mutations that you\nwere talking about in your thesis.\n<br>I need to know if they may\nhave already happened.\n<br>In people alive today.\n<br>Professor?\n<br>I think we should just\ntalk when you're sober.\n<br>Do you have any time tomorrow?\n<br>Something tells me you already\nknow the answer to your question.\n<br>This is very important to me, and if\nI can help you, I will do my utmost.\n<br>Thank you.\n<br>Still drinking champagne, Bob?\n<br>I will pass.\n<br>Okay, well, so much\nfor the pleasantries.\n<br>I was wondering who you told\nabout our little arrangement.\n<br>No one.\n<br>- He's telling the truth.\n- Good.\n<br>Well, I guess we're done here.\n<br>Let's wrap things up, shall we?\n<br>Oh, I knew better\nthan to trust you.\n<br>Now, you let me walk out\nof here with my money,\n<br>or I will pull this\npin, and we all die.\n<br>Go ahead. Pull it.\n<br>I'll do it, I swear to God.\n<br>No, you won't.\n<br>But I will.\n<br>You're one of them?\n<br>Very astute of you, colonel hendry.\n<br>You want to guess what I can do?\n<br>I've got the power to absorb energy.\nIt keeps me young.\n<br>But that's the boring part.\n<br>The fun stuff is what I can\ndo with it once I've got it.\n<br>The advent\nof the nuclear age\n<br>may have accelerated\nthe mutation process.\n<br>Individuals with extraordinary\nabilities may already be among us.\n<br>Thank you very much.\n<br>Mactaggert, you really think\nthat some crackpot scientist\n<br>is going to make me believe in\nsparkly dames and vanishing men?\n<br>You just bought yourself a one-way\nticket back to the typing pool.\n<br>This meeting is over.\n<br>Please sit down, agent mactaggert.\n<br>I didn't really expect\nyou to believe me,\n<br>given that all you could think\nabout during my presentation was\n<br>what sort of pie they were\nserving in the commissary.\n<br>It's apple pecan.\n<br>I haven't been entirely honest\nwith you, love. I'm sorry.\n<br>You see, one of the\nmany spectacular things\n<br>my mutation allows me to do\nis that I can read your mind.\n<br>I've seen this before\nin a magic show.\n<br>Are you going to ask us to think of\na number between one and 10 now?\n<br>No, agent stryker. Although,\n<br>I could ask you about\nyour son, William,\n<br>who you were thinking\nabout, which is very nice.\n<br>But I think I'd rather ask you\nabout the Jupiter missiles\n<br>America are currently\nplacing in Turkey.\n<br>He's a goddamn spy.\n<br>You brought a goddamned\nspy into this facility!\n<br>How's that for a magic trick?\n<br>Best I've ever seen.\n<br>I want them out of here.\n<br>And locked down until I can\nfigure out what to do.\n<br>My facility is off-site.\n<br>I'll take them.\n<br>I can't believe this. You'd\nthink the director of the CIA\n<br>would have a little more composure.\n<br>We should be going\nafter Shaw right now.\n<br>But instead, he's out there\nworrying about the wrong mutants.\n<br>What are we going to do, levene?\n<br>Levene?\nLevene, what's wrong with you?\n<br>Absolutely nothing.\n<br>I've just frozen him for a moment\nbecause I'd like to talk to you.\n<br>It's good, isn't it?\n<br>I'm as interested in this\nSebastian Shaw as you are.\n<br>If you still want my help, meet me on\nthe third floor of the parking garage.\n<br>I've always known that\nthere were people like you out there.\n<br>I've been the laughing stock of this\nagency for years, but I knew it!\n<br>You are going to love my facility.\n<br>- That's going to have to wait.\n- Why?\n<br>Agent mactaggert has a\nlead on Sebastian Shaw,\n<br>and if we don't move now, apparently,\nwe're going to lose him.\n<br>What?\nNot only can he read minds,\n<br>he can communicate\nwith them as well.\n<br>Moira and I have just had\na lovely conversation.\n<br>Yes, we did.\n<br>That is incredible!\n<br>But I cannot take you anywhere else\nwithout permission from upstairs.\n<br>Like to see one more\nmagic trick? Okay.\n<br>Get in the car. Good idea.\n<br>Herr doktor.\n<br>Little Erik lensherr.\n<br>He's here to kill you.\n<br>What kind of a greeting is that...\n<br>After all these years?\n<br>Emma.\n<br>We don't harm our own kind.\n<br>Ah! Now it's a party.\n<br>This\nis the us coast guard.\n<br>Do not attempt to move your\nvessel. Stay where you are.\n<br>They have a telepath.\n<br>I've lost Shaw.\nI've lost Shaw.\n<br>There's something blocking me.\n<br>This has never\nhappened to me before.\n<br>I think there's someone\nlike me on that ship.\n<br>Like you?\nI'm sorry, a telepath.\n<br>This is incredible.\n<br>I could actually feel her\ninside my mind. I'm very sorry,\n<br>but I don't think I'm gonna\nbe much help tonight.\n<br>You're on your own.\n<br>Oh, my God! Jesus!\n<br>Get inside.\n<br>Stop, stop, stop.\n<br>Charles!\nAre you okay?\n<br>There's someone else out there.\n<br>There.\n<br>Time to go.\n<br>Let go!\n<br>You have to let it go!\n<br>You've got to put someone\nin the water to help him.\n<br>Let it go!\nYou have to let it go!\n<br>You can't. You'll drown.\nYou have to let go.\n<br>I know what this means to\nyou, but you're going to die.\n<br>Please, Erik, calm your mind.\n<br>Get off me!\nGet off!\n<br>Calm down! Just breathe.\nWe're here!\n<br>Who are you?\nMy name is Charles Xavier.\n<br>You were in my head.\nHow did you do that?\n<br>You have your tricks,\nI have mine.\n<br>I'm like you.\nJust calm your mind.\n<br>I thought I was alone.\n<br>You're not alone.\n<br>Erik, you're not alone.\n<br>Welcome to my facility.\n<br>My mission has been to investigate\n<br>the application of paranormal\npowers in military defense.\n<br>Or offense.\n<br>This guy Shaw, schmidt,\n<br>whatever you want to call him,\n<br>he's working with the Russians.\n<br>We might need your help to stop him.\nMarvelous.\n<br>So we're to be the CIA's\nnew mutant division, yes?\n<br>Something like that.\n<br>It's a supersonic.\nThe most advanced plane ever built.\n<br>You should see it in real life.\nIt's incredible.\n<br>Hank, these are the special new\nrecruits I was telling you about.\n<br>This is Hank McCoy, one of our\nmost talented young researchers.\n<br>How wonderful. Another\nmutant, already here.\n<br>Why didn't you say?\n<br>Say what?\n<br>Because you don't know.\n<br>I am so, so terribly sorry.\n<br>Hank?\n<br>You didn't ask,\nso I didn't tell.\n<br>So, your\nmutation is what?\n<br>You're super-smart?\n<br>I'll say.\n<br>Hank here graduated\nHarvard at the age of 15.\n<br>I wish that's all it was.\n<br>You're among friends now, Hank.\n<br>You can show off.\n<br>Splendid.\n<br>I'm sorry.\n<br>Ta-da!\n<br>You're amazing.\n<br>Really?\n<br>\"The presence\nof us missiles in Turkey\"\n<br>\"represents an\nunprecedented threat\"\n<br>\"to the people of\nthe Soviet union,\"\n<br>warned Russian foreign minister\ngromyko earlier today.\n<br>But he was quick to insist the\nRussians would not be the first\n<br>to initiate any military action.\n<br>Yeah, we'll fix that as\nsoon as we get to Russia.\n<br>Unless the CIA find us first.\n<br>I'll take care of them, too.\n<br>If that telepath gets\ninside your head,\n<br>he won't be as much fun as I am.\n<br>Already in hand, my love.\n<br>The Russians\n<br>made me this.\n<br>So, what am I thinking?\n<br>I don't know.\n<br>I was thinking that you are\nthe most exquisite thing\n<br>I have ever seen in my life.\n<br>And that this needs ice.\n<br>Fetch me some.\n<br>There's a good girl.\n<br>I promised myself I'd find a cure\never since I was a little boy.\n<br>You have no idea what\nI'd give to feel\n<br>normal. Normal.\n<br>Charles has never understood.\n<br>He's different, but\nhe's never had to hide.\n<br>Hank, this serum\nthat you're making,\n<br>it doesn't affect\nabilities, right?\n<br>Just appearance.\nIt normalizes it.\n<br>Yeah.\n<br>Do you think it would work on me?\n<br>I can look into it, if you'd like.\n<br>It's the least I can do\n<br>after asking you to come down\nhere with such a weird request.\n<br>I have to admit, usually when guys ask\nme out, they're not after my blood.\n<br>Sorry. I didn't intend\nto be forward. I was just...\n<br>I was excited. You know, the\nnature of your mutation.\n<br>If any genes hold the key to\nchanging appearance, it's yours.\n<br>Hank, you weren't being forward.\n<br>That's kind of what I meant.\n<br>No.\n<br>But I'm just sorry if\nyou thought I was.\n<br>And I'm sorry that you weren't.\n<br>Go ahead.\nTake the blood.\n<br>Sorry.\nDid I hurt you?\n<br>Kinky.\n<br>By the way, if I looked like you,\n<br>I wouldn't change a thing.\n<br>From what\nI know about you,\n<br>I'm surprised you've\nmanaged to stay this long.\n<br>What do you know about me?\n<br>Everything.\n<br>Then you know to\nstay out of my head.\n<br>I'm sorry, Erik, but I've\nseen what Shaw did to you.\n<br>I've felt your agony.\n<br>I can help you.\n<br>I don't need your help.\n<br>Don't kid yourself. You\nneeded my help last night.\n<br>It's not just me you're\nwalking away from.\n<br>Here you have the chance to be part of\nsomething much bigger than yourself.\n<br>I won't stop you leaving.\nI could.\n<br>But I won't.\n<br>Shaw has got friends.\n<br>You could do with some.\n<br>Hank turned that radar\ninstallation into a transmitter.\n<br>It's designed to amplify brainwaves\n<br>so it could enhance\nyour telepathic powers,\n<br>help us find other mutants\nfor our division.\n<br>What if they don't want\nto be found by you?\n<br>Erik.\n<br>You decided to stay.\n<br>If a new species is\nbeing discovered,\n<br>it should be by it's own kind.\n<br>Charles and I find the mutants.\nNo suits.\n<br>First of all, that's\nmy machine out there.\n<br>Second of all, and much more\nimportantly, this is Charles' decision.\n<br>Charles is fine with the\nCIA being involved.\n<br>Isn't that right?\n<br>No. I'm sorry, but\nI'm with Erik.\n<br>We'll find them alone.\n<br>What if I say no?\n<br>Then good luck using your\ninstallation without me.\n<br>I call it cerebro.\n<br>As in the Spanish for \"brain.\" Yes.\n<br>Okay, so, the electrodes connect Charles\nto the transmitter on the roof.\n<br>When he picks up a mutant, his brain\nsends a signal through a relay\n<br>and then the co-ordinates of their\nlocation are printed out here.\n<br>You designed this?\n<br>Yeah.\n<br>What an adorable lab\nrat you make, Charles.\n<br>Don't spoil this for me, Erik.\n<br>I've been a lab rat. I\nknow one when I see one.\n<br>Okay, great. Are you sure\nwe can't shave your head?\n<br>Don't touch my hair. Okay.\n<br>It's working!\n<br>For that, daddy-o, you\nget a private dance.\n<br>You cats know it's\ndouble for both, right?\n<br>Mmm.\n<br>No, that won't be necessary.\nAlthough, I'm sure it'd be magical.\n<br>We were thinking more,\nwe'll show you ours\n<br>if you show us yours.\n<br>Baby, that is not the way\nit works around here.\n<br>More tea, vicar?\n<br>Don't mind if I do.\n<br>My turn.\n<br>How would you like a job where\nyou get to keep your clothes on?\n<br>Where to, fellas? Richmond,\nVirginia, please.\n<br>Right, so, you want the airport?\nThe station? What?\n<br>No, we were rather hoping you\nwould take us all the way.\n<br>That's a six-hour drive.\n<br>That will give us\nplenty of time to talk.\n<br>What does the government\nwant with a guy like Alex summers?\n<br>I hope you're not planning\non putting him with others.\n<br>First guy I've ever met who actually\nprefers solitary confinement.\n<br>Crazy, huh?\n<br>What?\n<br>You like fish. I like fish, too.\n<br>Maybe we should get a bite\nsometime, talk about it?\n<br>I'd rather go out with the fish.\n<br>These fish?\n<br>Excuse me, I'm Erik lensherr.\nCharles Xavier.\n<br>Go fuck yourself.\n<br>There's nothing on radar?\nNothing.\n<br>Sonar?\nNyet.\n<br>Then we have a problem.\n<br>Beautiful, isn't it?\n<br>The reason we exist.\n<br>We are the children\nof the atom, my love.\n<br>We have a situation.\n<br>The telepath.\n<br>I shouldn't be able to\nfeel him at this distance.\n<br>It's like his reach is\n<br>amplified.\n<br>They're recruiting.\n<br>You go on to Russia.\nI'll handle them.\n<br>I can't stop thinking\nabout the others out there.\n<br>All those minds that I touched.\nI could feel them.\n<br>Their isolation, their\nhopes, their ambitions.\n<br>I tell you, we are at the start\nof something incredible, Erik.\n<br>We can help them.\n<br>Can we?\n<br>Identification,\nthat's how it starts.\n<br>And ends with being rounded up,\nexperimented on, eliminated.\n<br>Not this time.\n<br>We have common enemies.\nShaw, the Russians.\n<br>They need us.\n<br>For now.\n<br>We should\nthink of code names.\n<br>We're government agents now, we\nshould have secret code names.\n<br>I want to be called mystique.\n<br>Damn! I wanted to\nbe called mystique.\n<br>Well, tough. I called it.\n<br>And I'm way more\nmysterious than you.\n<br>Darwin, what about you?\n<br>Well, \"Darwin\" is\nalready a nickname,\n<br>and, you know, it sort of fits.\n<br>Adapt to survive and all.\n<br>Check this out.\n<br>Whoa!\n<br>That was incredible. Thank you.\n<br>What about you?\n<br>I'm going to be.\n<br>Banshee.\n<br>Why do you want to be named\nafter a wailing spirit?\n<br>You might want to cover your ears.\n<br>Your turn.\n<br>My stage name is angel.\n<br>It kind of fits. You can fly?\n<br>Uh-huh. And...\n<br>What's your name?\n<br>How about big foot?\n<br>You know what they say\nabout guys with big feet.\n<br>And yours are kind of small.\n<br>Okay, now.\n<br>Alex, what is your gift?\nWhat can you do?\n<br>It's not...\n<br>I just can't do it. I\ncan't do it in here.\n<br>Why\ndon't you just do it out there?\n<br>Alex!\nAlex! Alex!\n<br>That's the spirit!\n<br>Get down when I tell you.\n<br>\"Get down\nwhen I tell you.\"\n<br>Get back.\n<br>Get back!\n<br>Whatever.\n<br>We have intel that Shaw is meeting with\nthe Russian defense chief in moscow.\n<br>So go ahead. Say it.\n<br>I'm not here to say \"I told you\nso.\" You know why I'm here.\n<br>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clearance\nto bring along your mutants.\n<br>Fight fire with fire.\nIt makes sense.\n<br>Wait! You're okay with this?\n<br>Sending in a bunch of\nuntrained, unauthorized freaks?\n<br>These freaks are dedicated,\nhardworking people.\n<br>Plane leaves for Russia in an hour.\n<br>I'm telling you, these kids\nare not ready for Shaw.\n<br>I think they're gonna surprise you.\n<br>They're an exceptional\nbunch of young people.\n<br>What the hell?\n<br>Come on! You can\ngo harder than that.\n<br>Harder!\n<br>What are you doing?\n<br>Who destroyed the statue?\n<br>It was Alex.\n<br>No, havok.\n<br>We have to call him havok.\nThat's his name now.\n<br>And we were thinking, you\nshould be Professor x\n<br>and you should be Magneto.\n<br>Exceptional.\n<br>I expect more from you.\n<br>We got a problem. What?\n<br>I'm so sorry. This\nwasn't on the map.\n<br>No matter what\nhappens, act normally.\n<br>I'll take care of this, all right?\n<br>Now, listen to me...\n<br>- Where are you going?\n- To our farm.\n<br>Open the back.\n<br>As you wish.\n<br>Easy, easy.\nTake it easy, chaps.\n<br>- Anything back there?\n- Nothing. It's empty.\n<br>- Everything okay?\n- Yes.\n<br>- Where is Shaw?\n- I don't know.\n<br>But if she's a telepath and I\nread her, she'll know we're here.\n<br>Let me try something else.\n<br>Shaw sends his apologies\nbut he's indisposed.\n<br>He asked me to come in his place.\n<br>And between you and I, honey,\nI'm a lot better company.\n<br>Please, come in.\n<br>He's not coming.\n<br>So, what now, boss?\n<br>Now, nothing. We're here\nfor Shaw. Mission aborted.\n<br>The hell it is. Erik.\n<br>She's his right-hand woman.\nThat's good enough for me.\n<br>The CIA invading the home of a senior\nSoviet official.

They're\nright through that door.\n<br>Just let us normal people go.\nWe're no threat...\n<br>- Where is the telepath?\n- Not here.\n<br>Too bad.\n<br>Well, at least I can take\nthis silly thing off.\n<br>Good evening.\nMy name is Sebastian Shaw.\n<br>And I am not here to hurt you.\n<br>Freeze!\n<br>Azazel.\n<br>My friends, there is\na revolution coming.\n<br>When mankind discovers who\nwe are, what we can do,\n<br>each of us will face a choice.\n<br>Be enslaved\n<br>or rise up to rule.\n<br>Choose freely, but know that\nif you are not with us,\n<br>then, by definition, you are\n<br>against us.\n<br>So, you can stay\n<br>and fight for the people\nwho hate and fear you,\n<br>and queens.\n<br>Angel. Are you kidding me?\n<br>Come on.\n<br>We don't belong here.\n<br>And that's nothing\nto be ashamed of.\n<br>We have to do something.\n<br>Stop.\nI'm coming with you.\n<br>Good choice.\n<br>So, tell me about your mutation.\n<br>Well, I adapt to survive.\n<br>So, I guess I'm coming with you.\n<br>I like that.\n<br>Alex! Get out!\n<br>Do it!\n<br>Protecting your fellow mutants?\n<br>That's a noble gesture.\n<br>Feels good.\n<br>Adapt to this.\n<br>Hello.\n<br>Once again, my sympathies for your\ntreatment at the hands of the CIA.\n<br>These Americans are ruthless.\n<br>Now they have their missiles\nplaced in Turkey...\n<br>I expect you'll be planning new\nmissile sites of your own.\n<br>Somewhere you know the American\nearly-warning system won't help.\n<br>I hear Cuba is lovely\nthis time of year.\n<br>And so close to Florida.\n<br>Missiles in Cuba?\n<br>You're serious?\n<br>We may as well declare war.\n<br>Maybe I wasn't clear enough.\n<br>You will make this happen.\n<br>Okay.\n<br>Let's see\nwhat kgb think about this.\n<br>Hello?\nGeneral armivolkoff.\n<br>It's nothing.\n<br>Raven?\n<br>We've made arrangements for you\nto be taken home immediately.\n<br>We're not going home.\nWhat?\n<br>He's not going back to prison.\n<br>He killed Darwin.\n<br>All the more reason\nfor you to leave.\n<br>This is over.\n<br>Darwin's dead, Charles.\n<br>And we can't even bury him.\n<br>We can avenge him.\n<br>Erik, a word, please.\n<br>They're just kids.\n<br>No. They were kids.\n<br>Shaw has his army, we need ours.\n<br>We'll have to train.\n<br>All of us.\n<br>Yes? Yeah.\n<br>Well, we can't stay here.\n<br>Even if they reopen the\ndepartment, it's not safe.\n<br>We've got nowhere to go.\n<br>Yes, we do.\n<br>The law says we've\ngot to turn her over.\n<br>The law applies\nto human beings.\n<br>The same laws don't apply to\nmutants. They're too dangerous.\n<br>In times like this, security is\nmore important than liberty.\n<br>There is a war coming, John.\n<br>Yes,\n<br>but a war with who?\n<br>Excellent question.\n<br>Though I wouldn't call\nit a war, exactly.\n<br>That suggests both sides stand\nan equal chance of winning.\n<br>Captain, no sign of\nany American ships.\n<br>Maintain course, full ahead.\n<br>The Russians have\nsent their warheads to Cuba.\n<br>We have a week before the\nship hits the coast.\n<br>Our fleet can be on this line when\nthe Russian missile ship arrives.\n<br>If that ship crosses the line,\n<br>they will have declared war\nagainst the United States.\n<br>And we will have no choice but to\nretaliate with a full nuclear response.\n<br>Do we agree?\n<br>Dispatch the 7th fleet.\n<br>This is yours?\n<br>No, it's ours.\n<br>Honestly, Charles. I don't know how you\nsurvived, living in such hardship.\n<br>Well, it was a hardship\nsoftened by me.\n<br>Come on. Time for the tour.\n<br>Dear comrades...\n<br>The United States have\ndispatched warships for Cuba.\n<br>This leaves us with no choice.\n<br>Comrade first secretary...\n<br>We must send in our fleet.\n<br>Dispatch the fleet!\n<br>President Kennedy\nhas signed a formal proclamation\n<br>setting up a blockade of all\nmissiles bound for Cuba.\n<br>The Soviet\nunion reacted by terming it.\n<br>\"A step along the road to\nunleashing a thermo-nuclear war.\"\n<br>You're sure?\n<br>I'm sure.\n<br>All right.\n<br>No. No, I can't. I'm sorry.\n<br>I can't shoot anybody point\nblank, let alone my friend.\n<br>Oh, come on. You know\nI can deflect it.\n<br>You're always telling me\nI should push myself.\n<br>If you know you can deflect it,\n<br>then you're not\nchallenging yourself.\n<br>Whatever happened to the man who\nwas trying to raise a submarine?\n<br>I can't. Something that big?\n<br>I need the situation, the anger...\n<br>No, the anger is not enough.\n<br>It's gotten the job\ndone all this time.\n<br>It's nearly gotten you\nkilled all this time.\n<br>Come here.\n<br>Let's try something a\nlittle more challenging.\n<br>My stepfather took the possibility of\nnuclear war quite seriously. This way.\n<br>That is why he had this\nbunker built down here.\n<br>I thought we could use it as\na practice range of sorts.\n<br>You don't think I'm going\nto blow through the walls?\n<br>He had this place built\nto withstand a nuclear bomb.\n<br>I think it can handle you, Alex.\n<br>You know, when I do this,\nbad things tend to happen.\n<br>That's because you can't\ncontrol it. It controls you.\n<br>That's why we're here, Alex.\nIt's why we're training.\n<br>What you're doing is incredible.\n<br>You're hitting a pitch\nwith sound waves\n<br>that have the same resonant frequency\nas the glass. That's why it shatters.\n<br>But this, it's like any\nother muscle in the body.\n<br>You can control it.\n<br>\"In each of us, two\nnatures are at war.\"\n<br>Robert Louis Stevenson,\nJekyll and Hyde.\n<br>Top marks.\n<br>The story wasn't really about\ngood and evil though, was it?\n<br>It was about man's animal nature\n<br>and his struggle to\ncontrol it, to conform.\n<br>And it's that struggle\nwhich is holding you back.\n<br>No, Jekyll was afraid of\nwhat he could be capable of.\n<br>And you are, too.\n<br>If you're serious about me doing\nthis, you might want to get back.\n<br>All right.\n<br>Shall I shut the door? Yeah.\n<br>Whenever you're ready.\n<br>Oh, my God!\n<br>I will teach you to\ncontrol this, Alex.\n<br>And you're sure that\nthis will work?\n<br>Anything is possible.\nI based the design...\n<br>Hank, stop talking. Come on.\n<br>Now, remember. Scream\nas hard as you can.\n<br>You need the sound waves\nto be supersonic.\n<br>Catch them at the right angle\nand they should carry you.\n<br>They should carry me.\n<br>That's reassuring. Good luck.\n<br>And don't forget to scream.\n<br>Now, if you want to\nbeat me this time,\n<br>you have to set the beast free.\n<br>On your marks,\n<br>get set,\n<br>go!\n<br>Congratulations, my friend.\n<br>Robert Louis Stevenson\nwould have been proud.\n<br>Impressive, Hank.\n<br>With feet like those, all\nyou need is a red nose.\n<br>Right, bozo?\n<br>I'm done here. Thank you, Alex.\n<br>Come on, Hank.\n<br>If you're using half your\nconcentration to look normal,\n<br>then you're only half paying attention\nto whatever else you're doing.\n<br>Just pointing out something\nthat could save your life.\n<br>You want society to accept you,\n<br>but you can't even accept yourself.\n<br>Sexy!\n<br>Well, this is just the prototype.\n<br>The real one will look\nconsiderably better.\n<br>It will be a whole suit. See, these\nsensors measure your energy output.\n<br>This panel focuses it and\nthe excess is absorbed.\n<br>Try hitting the one in the middle.\n<br>Just the one in the middle, mind.\n<br>Good luck.\n<br>You got to see this.

Try again.\n<br>Hey! Well done.\n<br>The president is about\nto make his address.\n<br>It shall be the policy of\nthis nation to regard any nuclear missile\n<br>crossing the embargo\nline that surrounds Cuba\n<br>as an attack by the Soviet\nunion on the United States\n<br>requiring a full retaliatory\nresponse upon the Soviet union...\n<br>That's where we're\ngoing to find Shaw.\n<br>How do you know?\n<br>Two superpowers facing off and\nhe wants to start world war III.\n<br>He won't leave anything to chance.\n<br>So much for diplomacy.\n<br>I suggest you all get\na good night's sleep.\n<br>Ultimately\nleads to war.\n<br>Tensions mount as the\nSoviet missile ship nears Cuba.\n<br>All diplomatic efforts to avert\nnuclear war have thus far failed.\n<br>As the American people\nready themselves\n<br>for the likelihood\nof an atomic attack,\n<br>there are widespread\nreports of panic-buying,\n<br>supermarkets cleared, as shelters\nunused since the second world war\n<br>are stocked for what may lie ahead.\n<br>In all it's history, America has\nnever faced a greater threat.\n<br>The world is primed for war\n<br>and there's no one to stop me.\n<br>Come in.\n<br>Hey.\n<br>I have a surprise for you.\n<br>I isolated the right\nmarker in your DNA sample.\n<br>The serum works like an antibiotic,\n<br>attacking the cells that\n'cause our physical mutation.\n<br>It won't affect our abilities,\njust our appearance.\n<br>Do you still want to do this?\n<br>Should we have to hide?\n<br>Well, you already do.\n<br>You're hiding right now,\nlike I have my whole life.\n<br>I don't want to feel like a freak all\nthe time.

No.\n<br>Well,\n<br>this is a surprise.\n<br>The nice kind?\n<br>Get out, raven. I\nwant to go to bed.\n<br>Maybe in a few years.\n<br>How about now?\n<br>I prefer the real raven.\n<br>I said the real raven.\n<br>Perfection.\n<br>Could you pass me my robe?\n<br>You don't have to hide.\n<br>Have you ever looked at a tiger\n<br>and thought you ought\nto cover it up?\n<br>No, but...\n<br>You're an exquisite\ncreature, raven.\n<br>All your life, the world\nhas tried to tame you.\n<br>It's time for you to be free.\n<br>You know, sometimes I wonder\nwhat my life would have been like\n<br>if you hadn't found\nme here that night.\n<br>Sorry, what? You...\n<br>For God's sake, raven!\n<br>Where are your clothes?\nPut some clothes on.\n<br>That's not what you said\nwhen you first saw me.\n<br>But I guess pets are always cuter\nwhen they're little, right?\n<br>Raven, I don't know what's\ngotten into you lately.\n<br>I thought you'd be in a good mood.\n<br>Hank, he tells me that he's found the\nanswer to your cosmetic problem.\n<br>Are you gonna tell\nme what's the matter\n<br>or do I have to read your mind?\n<br>You promised me you\nwould never do that.\n<br>Until recently,\n<br>I never had to use my power to know\nwhat you were thinking, raven.\n<br>Charles, I used to think it was going\nto be you and me against the world.\n<br>But no matter how\nbad the world gets,\n<br>you don't want to be\nagainst it, do you?\n<br>You want to be a part of it.\n<br>What the hell happened here?\n<br>Hank has been busy.\n<br>Do we really have to wear these?\n<br>As none of us mutated to\nendure extreme g-force\n<br>or being riddled by bullets,\nI suggest we suit up.\n<br>Where is Hank?\n<br>I'm here.\n<br>Hank?\n<br>It didn't attack the cells.\n<br>It enhanced them.\n<br>It didn't work.\n<br>Yes, it did, Hank.\nDon't you see?\n<br>This is who you were meant to be.\n<br>This is you.\n<br>No more hiding.\n<br>You never looked better, man.\nHank!\n<br>Don't mock me!\n<br>Hank, put him\ndown immediately, please.\n<br>Hank! Hank!\n<br>I wasn't.\n<br>Even I got to admit you\nlook pretty badass.\n<br>I think I got a new name for you.\n<br>Beast.\n<br>You're sure you can fly this thing?\n<br>Of course I can.

Now!\n<br>Gun boss, target cargo\nship bearing 1-8-0.\n<br>Fleet reports all weapons ready.\n<br>From the kremlin, sir.\n<br>New orders.

Standing by, sir.\n<br>Whoa!\n<br>It looks pretty messy out there.\n<br>Aral sea you are ordered\nto turn around.\n<br>The crew of the aral sea are\nall dead. Shaw's been there.\n<br>He's still here, somewhere.\n<br>He set the ship on course\nfor the embargo line.\n<br>If that ship crosses the line,\n<br>our boys are going to blow it up.\n<br>And the war begins.\n<br>Unless they're not our boys.\n<br>USS independence, this\nis Alexander nevsky.\n<br>We have lost control\nof our cargo ship.\n<br>She has been instructed to stop.\n<br>Do not fire!

Five,\n<br>four...\n<br>Hold on!\n<br>Nyet.\n<br>What was that? The Russians.\n<br>They have fired on\ntheir own ship.\n<br>A little warning next\ntime, Professor.\n<br>Sorry about that. You all right?\nYeah.\n<br>Son of a...\n<br>Give me cinclant on the horn.\nI want a new set of orders.\n<br>Congratulations, comrade.\n<br>You just averted nuclear war!\n<br>What?\n<br>Take him to the brig.\n<br>What?\nWhat just happened?\n<br>They say the comrade lost his mind.\n<br>The Americans are applauding.\n<br>They're here. That\ntelepath is powerful.\n<br>We're moving to a back-up plan.\n<br>That was inspired, Charles.\n<br>Thank you very much, but I\nstill can't locate Shaw.\n<br>He's down there. We\nneed to find him now.\n<br>Hank?\n<br>Is there anything unusual\non the radar or scanners?\n<br>No. Nothing.\n<br>Well, then he must be underwater.\n<br>And obviously, we don't have sonar.\n<br>Yes, we do. Yes, we do.\n<br>They are ready for war.\n<br>We just need to strike another\nmatch to light the fuse.\n<br>And we still have the most\npowerful weapon of all.\n<br>Me.\n<br>Turn the nuclear reactor to 100% output\nand make sure I'm not disturbed.\n<br>Hank, level the bloody plane!\n<br>Whoa! You back right off.\n<br>Beast, open the bomb bay doors!\n<br>Remember! This is a muscle.\n<br>You control it!\n<br>You'll be in here\nthe entire time!\n<br>We'll see you soon!\n<br>On my mark! Three! Two!\n<br>One!

It's\ngonna get bumpy.\n<br>Erik, take my hand!\n<br>Moira? Moira, are you all right?\n<br>Yeah, I'm okay.\n<br>I read the teleporter's mind.\n<br>Shaw is drawing all the\npower out of his sub.\n<br>He's turning himself into\nsome kind of nuclear bomb.\n<br>We got no time. The geiger\ncount is going out of control.\n<br>Moira, this is what\nwe're gonna do.\n<br>Get on the radio and tell them to\nclear both fleets out immediately.\n<br>I'm going in. Beast,\nhavok, back him up.\n<br>Erik, I can guide you\nthrough once you're in,\n<br>but I need you to shut down\nwhatever it is that's blocking me,\n<br>then we just hope to God it's not\ntoo late for me to stop him.\n<br>Got it. Good luck!\n<br>Raven, stop! I'm\ngoing to help them.\n<br>We don't have time for this.\n<br>If anything comes in that entrance,\n<br>you're taking care of it, yes?\n<br>Fine.\n<br>Beast!\n<br>If we go, you go!\n<br>We believe Shaw is trying to\ndetonate some kind of bomb.\n<br>Erik, make for the\nmiddle of the vessel.\n<br>That's the point my\nmind can't penetrate.\n<br>We have to assume that\nthat's where Shaw is.\n<br>Gangway! Gangway! Gangway!\n<br>That's the nuclear reactor.\nDisable it.\n<br>Stop! Don't move!\n<br>Get down!\n<br>Erik, you're there.\nYou've reached the void.\n<br>He's not here, Charles. Shaw's\nnot here!

Erik.\n<br>So good to see you again.\n<br>May I ask you something?\n<br>Why are you on their side?\n<br>He's gone. What?\n<br>He's gone into the void! I can't\ncommunicate with him there.\n<br>Why fight for a doomed\nrace who will hunt us down\n<br>as soon as they realize their\nreign is coming to an end?\n<br>Yeah! Yes!\n<br>I'm sorry for what\nhappened in the camps.\n<br>I truly am.\n<br>He's back! Erik, whatever\nyou're doing, keep doing it.\n<br>It's starting to work.\n<br>But everything I\ndid, I did for you.\n<br>To unlock your power,\n<br>to make you embrace it.\n<br>It's working!\n<br>I'm starting to see him, but\nI can't yet touch his mind.\n<br>You've come a long way\nfrom bending gates.\n<br>I'm so proud of you.\n<br>And you're just starting\nto scratch the surface.\n<br>Think how much further we could go\n<br>together.\n<br>Look out!\n<br>Stop!
